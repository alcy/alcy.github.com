    <h2>Chapter 29</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the residue of the elders of the captivity, and to the priests, to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon,   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>(after Jeconiah the king, the queen mother, the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the smiths had departed from Jerusalem),   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon). It said:</p><p><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall speak, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>“The LORD of Armies, the God of Israel, says, ‘Because you have sent letters in your own name to all the people who are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>“The LORD has made you priest in the place of Jehoiada the priest, that there may be officers in the LORD’s house, for every man who is crazy and makes himself a prophet, that you should put him in the stocks and in shackles.   <span class="verse" id="V27"></span>Now therefore, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who makes himself a prophet to you,   <span class="verse" id="V28"></span>because he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, The captivity is long. Build houses, and dwell in them. Plant gardens, and eat their fruit?” ’ ”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.   <span class="verse" id="V30"></span>Then the LORD’s word came to Jeremiah, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V31"></span>“Send to all of the captives, saying, ‘The LORD says concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: “Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, and I didn’t send him, and he has caused you to trust in a lie,”   <span class="verse" id="V32"></span>therefore the LORD says, “Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his offspring. He will not have a man to dwell among this people. He won’t see the good that I will do to my people,” says the LORD, “because he has spoken rebellion against the LORD.” ’ ” <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="jer30.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
