    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>“Isn’t a man forced to labor on earth?<br/>Aren’t his days like the days of a hired hand?<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>As a servant who earnestly desires the shadow,<br/>as a hireling who looks for his wages,<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>so I am made to possess months of misery,<br/>wearisome nights are appointed to me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>When I lie down, I say,<br/>‘When will I arise, and the night be gone?’<br/>I toss and turn until the dawning of the day.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust.<br/>My skin closes up, and breaks out afresh.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle,<br/>and are spent without hope.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Oh remember that my life is a breath.<br/>My eye will no more see good.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>The eye of him who sees me will see me no more.<br/>Your eyes will be on me, but I will not be.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away,<br/>so he who goes down to Sheol<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="job-7-9-note-1">
