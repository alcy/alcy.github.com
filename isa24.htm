    <h1>Isaiah</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 24</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Behold, the LORD makes the earth empty, makes it waste, turns it upside down, and scatters its inhabitants.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>It will be as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the creditor, so with the debtor; as with the taker of interest, so with the giver of interest.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>The earth will be utterly emptied and utterly laid waste; for the LORD has spoken this word.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>The earth mourns and fades away. The world languishes and fades away. The lofty people of the earth languish.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>The earth also is polluted under its inhabitants, because they have transgressed the laws, violated the statutes, and broken the everlasting covenant.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Therefore the curse has devoured the earth, and those who dwell therein are found guilty. Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men are left.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>The new wine mourns. The vine languishes. All the merry-hearted sigh.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>The mirth of tambourines ceases. The sound of those who rejoice ends. The joy of the harp ceases.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>They will not drink wine with a song. Strong drink will be bitter to those who drink it.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>The confused city is broken down. Every house is shut up, that no man may come in.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>There is a crying in the streets because of the wine. All joy is darkened. The mirth of the land is gone.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>The city is left in desolation, and the gate is struck with destruction.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>For it will be so within the earth among the peoples, as the shaking of an olive tree, as the gleanings when the vintage is done.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>These shall lift up their voice. They will shout for the majesty of the LORD. They cry aloud from the sea.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Therefore glorify the LORD in the east, even the name of the LORD, the God of Israel, in the islands of the sea!   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs. Glory to the righteous!</p><p>But I said, “I pine away! I pine away! woe is me!” The treacherous have dealt treacherously. Yes, the treacherous have dealt very treacherously.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Fear, the pit, and the snare are on you who inhabit the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>It will happen that he who flees from the noise of the fear will fall into the pit; and he who comes up out of the middle of the pit will be taken in the snare; for the windows on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble.   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>The earth is utterly broken. The earth is torn apart. The earth is shaken violently.   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>The earth will stagger like a drunken man, and will sway back and forth like a hammock. Its disobedience will be heavy on it, and it will fall and not rise again.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>It will happen in that day that the LORD will punish the army of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth on the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>They will be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and will be shut up in the prison; and after many days they will be visited.   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Then the moon will be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for the LORD of Armies will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem; and glory will be before his elders.</p></section>
