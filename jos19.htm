It ended at the Jordan.   <span class="verse" id="V34"></span>The border turned westward to Aznoth Tabor, and went out from there to Hukkok. It reached to Zebulun on the south, and reached to Asher on the west, and to Judah at the Jordan toward the sunrise.   <span class="verse" id="V35"></span>The fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Chinnereth,   <span class="verse" id="V36"></span>Adamah, Ramah, Hazor,   <span class="verse" id="V37"></span>Kedesh, Edrei, En Hazor,   <span class="verse" id="V38"></span>Iron, Migdal El, Horem, Beth Anath, and Beth Shemesh; nineteen cities with their villages.   <span class="verse" id="V39"></span>This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families, the cities with their villages.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V40"></span>The seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families.   <span class="verse" id="V41"></span>The border of their inheritance was Zorah, Eshtaol, Irshemesh,   <span class="verse" id="V42"></span>Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah,   <span class="verse" id="V43"></span>Elon, Timnah, Ekron,   <span class="verse" id="V44"></span>Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath,   <span class="verse" id="V45"></span>Jehud, Bene Berak, Gath Rimmon,   <span class="verse" id="V46"></span>Me Jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border opposite Joppa.   <span class="verse" id="V47"></span>The border of the children of Dan went out beyond them; for the children of Dan went up and fought against Leshem, and took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and lived therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their forefather.   <span class="verse" id="V48"></span>This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V49"></span>So they finished distributing the land for inheritance by its borders.
