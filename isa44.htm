    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Yet listen now, Jacob my servant,<br/>and Israel, whom I have chosen.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>This is what the LORD who made you,<br/>and formed you from the womb,<br/>who will help you says:<br/>“Don’t be afraid, Jacob my servant;<br/>and you, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For I will pour water on him who is thirsty,<br/>and streams on the dry ground.<br/>I will pour my Spirit on your descendants,<br/>and my blessing on your offspring;<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>and they will spring up among the grass,<br/>as willows by the watercourses.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>One will say, ‘I am the LORD’s.’<br/>Another will be called by the name of Jacob;<br/>and another will write with his hand ‘to the LORD,’<br/>and honor the name of Israel.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>This is what the LORD, the King of Israel,<br/>and his Redeemer, the LORD of Armies, says:<br/>“I am the first, and I am the last;<br/>and besides me there is no God.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Who is like me?<br/>Who will call,<br/>and will declare it,<br/>and set it in order for me,<br/>since I established the ancient people?<br/>Let them declare the things that are coming,<br/>and that will happen.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Don’t fear,<br/>neither be afraid.<br/>Haven’t I declared it to you long ago,<br/>and shown it?<br/>You are my witnesses.<br/>Is there a God besides me?<br/>Indeed, there is not.<br/>I don’t know any other Rock.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Everyone who makes a carved image is vain.<br/>The things that they delight in will not profit.<br/>Their own witnesses don’t see, nor know, that they may be disappointed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Who has fashioned a god,<br/>or molds an image that is profitable for nothing?<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Behold, all his fellows will be disappointed;<br/>and the workmen are mere men.<br/>Let them all be gathered together.<br/>Let them stand up.<br/>They will fear.<br/>They will be put to shame together.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>The blacksmith takes an ax,<br/>works in the coals,<br/>fashions it with hammers,<br/>and works it with his strong arm.<br/>He is hungry,<br/>and his strength fails;<br/>he drinks no water,<br/>and is faint.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>The carpenter stretches out a line.<br/>He marks it out with a pencil.<br/>He shapes it with planes.<br/>He marks it out with compasses,<br/>and shapes it like the figure of a man,<br/>with the beauty of a man,<br/>to reside in a house.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>He cuts down cedars for himself,<br/>and takes the cypress and the oak,<br/>and strengthens for himself one among the trees of the forest.<br/>He plants a cypress tree,<br/>and the rain nourishes it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Then it will be for a man to burn;<br/>and he takes some of it and warms himself.<br/>Yes, he burns it and bakes bread.<br/>Yes, he makes a god and worships it;<br/>he makes it a carved image, and falls down to it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>He burns part of it in the fire.<br/>With part of it, he eats meat.<br/>He roasts a roast and is satisfied.<br/>Yes, he warms himself<br/>and says, “Aha! I am warm. I have seen the fire.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>The rest of it he makes into a god,<br/>even his engraved image.<br/>He bows down to it and worships,<br/>and prays to it, and says, “Deliver me, for you are my god!”<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>They don’t know, neither do they consider,<br/>for he has shut their eyes, that they can’t see,<br/>and their hearts, that they can’t understand.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>No one thinks,<br/>neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say,<br/>“I have burned part of it in the fire.<br/>Yes, I have also baked bread on its coals.<br/>I have roasted meat and eaten it.<br/>Shall I make the rest of it into an abomination?<br/>Shall I bow down to a tree trunk?”<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>He feeds on ashes.<br/>A deceived heart has turned him aside;<br/>and he can’t deliver his soul,<br/>nor say, “Isn’t there a lie in my right hand?”<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Remember these things, Jacob and Israel,<br/>for you are my servant.<br/>I have formed you.<br/>You are my servant.<br/>Israel, you will not be forgotten by me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your transgressions,<br/>and, as a cloud, your sins.<br/>Return to me, for I have redeemed you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Sing, you heavens, for the LORD has done it!<br/>Shout, you lower parts of the earth!<br/>Break out into singing, you mountains, O forest, all of your trees,<br/>for the LORD has redeemed Jacob,<br/>and will glorify himself in Israel.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>The LORD, your Redeemer,<br/>and he who formed you from the womb says:<br/>“I am the LORD, who makes all things;<br/>who alone stretches out the heavens;<br/>who spreads out the earth by myself;<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>who frustrates the signs of the liars,<br/>and makes diviners mad;<br/>who turns wise men backward,<br/>and makes their knowledge foolish;<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>who confirms the word of his servant,<br/>and performs the counsel of his messengers;<br/>who says of Jerusalem, ‘She will be inhabited;’<br/>and of the cities of Judah, ‘They will be built,’<br/>and ‘I will raise up its waste places;’<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>who says to the deep, ‘Be dry,’<br/>and ‘I will dry up your rivers,’<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>who says of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure,’<br/>even saying of Jerusalem, ‘She will be built;’<br/>and of the temple, ‘Your foundation will be laid.’ ” <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="isa45.htm">→</a></span></p></blockquote></section>
