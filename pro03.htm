    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>My son, don’t forget my teaching,<br/>but let your heart keep my commandments,<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>for they will add to you length of days,<br/>years of life, and peace.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Don’t let kindness and truth forsake you.<br/>Bind them around your neck.<br/>Write them on the tablet of your heart.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>So you will find favor,<br/>and good understanding in the sight of God and man.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Trust in the LORD with all your heart,<br/>and don’t lean on your own understanding.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>In all your ways acknowledge him,<br/>and he will make your paths straight.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Don’t be wise in your own eyes.<br/>Fear the LORD, and depart from evil.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>It will be health to your body,<br/>and nourishment to your bones.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Honor the LORD with your substance,<br/>with the first fruits of all your increase;<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>so your barns will be filled with plenty,<br/>and your vats will overflow with new wine.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>My son, don’t despise the LORD’s discipline,<br/>neither be weary of his correction;<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>for whom the LORD loves, he corrects,<br/>even as a father reproves the son in whom he delights.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Happy is the man who finds wisdom,<br/>the man who gets understanding.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>For her good profit is better than getting silver,<br/>and her return is better than fine gold.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>She is more precious than rubies.<br/>None of the things you can desire are to be compared to her.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Length of days is in her right hand.<br/>In her left hand are riches and honor.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Her ways are ways of pleasantness.<br/>All her paths are peace.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her.<br/>Happy is everyone who retains her.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>By wisdom the LORD founded the earth.<br/>By understanding, he established the heavens.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>By his knowledge, the depths were broken up,<br/>and the skies drop down the dew.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>My son, let them not depart from your eyes.<br/>Keep sound wisdom and discretion,<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>so they will be life to your soul,<br/>and grace for your neck.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Then you shall walk in your way securely.<br/>Your foot won’t stumble.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>When you lie down, you will not be afraid.<br/>Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>Don’t be afraid of sudden fear,<br/>neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes;<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>for the LORD will be your confidence,<br/>and will keep your foot from being taken.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>Don’t withhold good from those to whom it is due,<br/>when it is in the power of your hand to do it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>Don’t say to your neighbor, “Go, and come again;<br/>tomorrow I will give it to you,”<br/>when you have it by you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>Don’t devise evil against your neighbor,<br/>since he dwells securely by you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>Don’t strive with a man without cause,<br/>if he has done you no harm.<br/><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>Don’t envy the man of violence.<br/>Choose none of his ways.<br/><span class="verse" id="V32"></span>For the perverse is an abomination to the LORD,<br/>but his friendship is with the upright.<br/><span class="verse" id="V33"></span>The LORD’s curse is in the house of the wicked,<br/>but he blesses the habitation of the righteous.<br/><span class="verse" id="V34"></span>Surely he mocks the mockers,<br/>but he gives grace to the humble.<br/><span class="verse" id="V35"></span>The wise will inherit glory,<br/>but shame will be the promotion of fools.</p></blockquote></section>
