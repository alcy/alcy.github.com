    <h1>Paul's Letter to the Galatians</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Brothers, even if a man is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, looking to yourself so that you also aren’t tempted.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>But let each man examine his own work, and then he will have reason to boast in himself, and not in someone else.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>For each man will bear his own burden.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>But let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Don’t be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption. But he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Let’s not be weary in doing good, for we will reap in due season if we don’t give up.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>So then, as we have opportunity, let’s do what is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>As many as desire to make a good impression in the flesh compel you to be circumcised, just so they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>For even they who receive circumcision don’t keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, so that they may boast in your flesh.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>As many as walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on God’s Israel.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.</p></section>
