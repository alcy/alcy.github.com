    <h1>The Acts of the Apostles</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 24</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>After five days, the high priest, Ananias, came down with certain elders and an orator, one Tertullus. They informed the governor against Paul.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>When he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, “Seeing that by you we enjoy much peace, and that prosperity is coming to this nation by your foresight,   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>But that I don’t delay you, I entreat you to bear with us and hear a few words.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>For we have found this man to be a plague, an instigator of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>He even tried to profane the temple, and we arrested him.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="act-24-6-note-1">

        </span>By examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>The Jews also joined in the attack, affirming that these things were so.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>When the governor had beckoned to him to speak, Paul answered, “Because I know that you have been a judge of this nation for many years, I cheerfully make my defense,   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>seeing that you can verify that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>In the temple they didn’t find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the synagogues or in the city.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Nor can they prove to you the things of which they now accuse me.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>But this I confess to you, that according to the Way, which they call a sect, so I serve the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets;   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>In this I also practice always having a conscience void of offense toward God and men.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Now after some years, I came to bring gifts for the needy to my nation, and offerings;   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>amid which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, not with a mob, nor with turmoil.   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>They ought to have been here before you and to make accusation if they had anything against me.   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Or else let these men themselves say what injustice they found in me when I stood before the council,   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>unless it is for this one thing that I cried standing among them, ‘Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged before you today!’ ”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, “When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will decide your case.”   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>He ordered the centurion that Paul should be kept in custody and should have some privileges, and not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>After some days, Felix came with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>As he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, “Go your way for this time, and when it is convenient for me, I will summon you.”   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>Meanwhile, he also hoped that money would be given to him by Paul, that he might release him. Therefore also he sent for him more often and talked with him.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.</p></section>
