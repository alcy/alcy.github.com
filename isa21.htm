    <h1>Isaiah</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 21</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>The burden of the wilderness of the sea.</p><p>As whirlwinds in the South sweep through, it comes from the wilderness, from an awesome land.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>A grievous vision is declared to me. The treacherous man deals treacherously, and the destroyer destroys. Go up, Elam; attack! I have stopped all of Media’s sighing.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Therefore my thighs are filled with anguish. Pains have seized me, like the pains of a woman in labor. I am in so much pain that I can’t hear. I am so dismayed that I can’t see.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>My heart flutters. Horror has frightened me. The twilight that I desired has been turned into trembling for me.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>They prepare the table. They set the watch. They eat. They drink. Rise up, you princes, oil the shield!   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>For the Lord said to me, “Go, set a watchman. Let him declare what he sees.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>When he sees a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of donkeys, a troop of camels, he shall listen diligently with great attentiveness.”   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>He cried like a lion: “Lord, I stand continually on the watchtower in the daytime, and every night I stay at my post.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Behold, here comes a troop of men, horsemen in pairs.” He answered, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the engraved images of her gods are broken to the ground.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>You are my threshing, and the grain of my floor!” That which I have heard from the LORD of Armies, the God of Israel, I have declared to you.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>The burden of Dumah.</p><p>One calls to me out of Seir, “Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?”   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>The watchman said, “The morning comes, and also the night. If you will inquire, inquire. Come back again.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>The burden on Arabia.</p><p>You will lodge in the thickets in Arabia, you caravans of Dedanites.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>They brought water to him who was thirsty. The inhabitants of the land of Tema met the fugitives with their bread.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow, and from the heat of battle.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>For the Lord said to me, “Within a year, as a worker bound by contract would count it, all the glory of Kedar will fail,   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, will be few; for the LORD, the God of Israel, has spoken it.”</p></section>
