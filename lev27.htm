The priest shall assign a value according to his ability to pay.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>“ ‘If it is an animal of which men offer an offering to the LORD, all that any man gives of such to the LORD becomes holy.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>He shall not alter it, nor exchange it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good. If he shall at all exchange animal for animal, then both it and that for which it is exchanged shall be holy.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>If it is any unclean animal, of which they do not offer as an offering to the LORD, then he shall set the animal before the priest;   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>and the priest shall evaluate it, whether it is good or bad.
