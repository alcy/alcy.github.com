The priest shall assign a value according to his ability to pay.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>“ ‘If it is an animal of which men offer an offering to the LORD, all that any man gives of such to the LORD becomes holy.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>He shall not alter it, nor exchange it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good. If he shall at all exchange animal for animal, then both it and that for which it is exchanged shall be holy.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>If it is any unclean animal, of which they do not offer as an offering to the LORD, then he shall set the animal before the priest;   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>and the priest shall evaluate it, whether it is good or bad. As the priest evaluates it, so it shall be.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of it to its valuation.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>“ ‘When a man dedicates his house to be holy to the LORD, then the priest shall evaluate it, whether it is good or bad.

If he exchanges it at all, then both it and that for which it is exchanged shall be holy.
