    <h1>Psalm 109</h1>

    <p class="psalm-subtitle">For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>God of my praise, don’t remain silent,<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>for they have opened the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit against me.<br/>They have spoken to me with a lying tongue.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>They have also surrounded me with words of hatred,<br/>and fought against me without a cause.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>In return for my love, they are my adversaries;<br/>but I am in prayer.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>They have rewarded me evil for good,<br/>and hatred for my love.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Set a wicked man over him.<br/>Let an adversary stand at his right hand.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>When he is judged, let him come out guilty.<br/>Let his prayer be turned into sin.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Let his days be few.<br/>Let another take his office.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Let his children be fatherless,<br/>and his wife a widow.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Let his children be wandering beggars.<br/>Let them be sought from their ruins.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Let the creditor seize all that he has.<br/>Let strangers plunder the fruit of his labor.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Let there be no one to extend kindness to him,<br/>neither let there be anyone to have pity on his fatherless children.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Let his posterity be cut off.<br/>In the generation following let their name be blotted out.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by the LORD.<br/>Don’t let the sin of his mother be blotted out.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Let them be before the LORD continually,<br/>that he may cut off their memory from the earth;<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>because he didn’t remember to show kindness,<br/>but persecuted the poor and needy man,<br/>the broken in heart, to kill them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Yes, he loved cursing, and it came to him.<br/>He didn’t delight in blessing, and it was far from him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment.<br/>It came into his inward parts like water,<br/>like oil into his bones.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Let it be to him as the clothing with which he covers himself,<br/>for the belt that is always around him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>This is the reward of my adversaries from the LORD,<br/>of those who speak evil against my soul.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>But deal with me, GOD the Lord,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="psa-109-21-note-1">

            The word translated “Lord” is “Adonai.”
            </span> for your name’s sake,<br/>because your loving kindness is good, deliver me;<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>for I am poor and needy.<br/>My heart is wounded within me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>I fade away like an evening shadow.<br/>I am shaken off like a locust.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>My knees are weak through fasting.<br/>My body is thin and lacks fat.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>I have also become a reproach to them.<br/>When they see me, they shake their head.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>Help me, LORD, my God.<br/>Save me according to your loving kindness;<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>that they may know that this is your hand;<br/>that you, LORD, have done it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>They may curse, but you bless.<br/>When they arise, they will be shamed,<br/>but your servant shall rejoice.<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>Let my adversaries be clothed with dishonor.<br/>Let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>I will give great thanks to the LORD with my mouth.<br/>Yes, I will praise him among the multitude.<br/><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>For he will stand at the right hand of the needy,<br/>to save him from those who judge his soul.</p></blockquote></section>
