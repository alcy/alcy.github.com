    <p class="subtitle">or, The Preacher</p>
    <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
    
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to produce an evil odor;<br/>so does a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>A wise man’s heart is at his right hand,<br/>but a fool’s heart at his left.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Yes also when the fool walks by the way, his understanding fails him, and he says to everyone that he is a fool.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>If the spirit of the ruler rises up against you, don’t leave your place; for gentleness lays great offenses to rest.</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, the sort of error which proceeds from the ruler.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in a low place.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>I have seen servants on horses, and princes walking like servants on the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>He who digs a pit may fall into it; and whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Whoever carves out stones may be injured by them. Whoever splits wood may be endangered by it.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>If the ax is blunt, and one doesn’t sharpen the edge, then he must use more strength; but skill brings success.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>If the snake bites before it is charmed, then is there no profit for the charmer’s tongue.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious; but a fool is swallowed by his own lips.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>A fool also multiplies words.</p><p>Man doesn’t know what will be; and that which will be after him, who can tell him?   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>The labor of fools wearies every one of them; for he doesn’t know how to go to the city.</p><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Woe to you, land, when your king is a child,<br/>and your princes eat in the morning!<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Happy are you, land, when your king is the son of nobles,<br/>and your princes eat in due season,<br/>for strength, and not for drunkenness!<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>By slothfulness the roof sinks in;<br/>and through idleness of the hands the house leaks.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>A feast is made for laughter,<br/>and wine makes the life glad;<br/>and money is the answer for all things.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Don’t curse the king, no, not in your thoughts;<br/>and don’t curse the rich in your bedroom,<br/>for a bird of the sky may carry your voice,<br/>and that which has wings may tell the matter.</p></blockquote></section>
