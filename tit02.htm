    <h1>Paul's Letter to Titus</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>But say the things which fit sound doctrine,   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in perseverance,   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good,   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>that they may train the young wives to love their husbands, to love their children,   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God’s word may not be blasphemed.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>In all things show yourself an example of good works. In your teaching, show integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility,   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>and soundness of speech that can’t be condemned, that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters and to be well-pleasing in all things, not contradicting,   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>not stealing, but showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present age;   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ,   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one despise you.</p></section>
