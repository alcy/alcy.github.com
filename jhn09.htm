    <h1>John</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Jesus answered, <span class="wj">“This man didn’t sin, nor did his parents, but that the works of God might be revealed in him. </span> <span class="verse" id="V4"></span><span class="wj">I must work the works of him who sent me while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work. </span> <span class="verse" id="V5"></span><span class="wj">While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”</span> <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>When he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man’s eyes with the mud,   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>and said to him, <span class="wj">“Go, wash in the pool of Siloam”</span> (which means “Sent”). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Therefore the neighbors and those who saw that he was blind before said, “Isn’t this he who sat and begged?”   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Others were saying, “It is he.” Still others were saying, “He looks like him.”</p><p>He said, “I am he.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>They therefore were asking him, “How were your eyes opened?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>He answered, “A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, <span class="wj">‘Go to the pool of Siloam and wash.’</span> So I went away and washed, and I received sight.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Then they asked him, “Where is he?”</p><p>He said, “I don’t know.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, “He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Some therefore of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, because he doesn’t keep the Sabbath.”</p><p>Others said, “How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?” So there was division among them.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Therefore they asked the blind man again, “What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?”</p><p>He said, “He is a prophet.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>The Jews therefore didn’t believe concerning him, that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>and asked them, “Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>His parents answered them, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>but how he now sees, we don’t know; or who opened his eyes, we don’t know. He is of age. Ask him. He will speak for himself.”   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>His parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Therefore his parents said, “He is of age. Ask him.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him, “Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>He therefore answered, “I don’t know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: that though I was blind, now I see.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>They said to him again, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>He answered them, “I told you already, and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don’t also want to become his disciples, do you?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>They insulted him and said, “You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.   <span class="verse" id="V29"></span>We know that God has spoken to Moses. But as for this man, we don’t know where he comes from.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>The man answered them, “How amazing! You don’t know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.   <span class="verse" id="V31"></span>We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does his will, he listens to him.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="jhn-9-31-note-1">

</span> <span class="verse" id="V32"></span>Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind.   <span class="verse" id="V33"></span>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V34"></span>They answered him, “You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us?” Then they threw him out.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V35"></span>Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, <span class="wj">“Do you believe in the Son of God?”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V36"></span>He answered, “Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V37"></span>Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with you.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V38"></span>He said, “Lord, I believe!” and he worshiped him.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V39"></span>Jesus said, <span class="wj">“I came into this world for judgment, that those who don’t see may see; and that those who see may become blind.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V40"></span>Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him, “Are we also blind?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V41"></span>Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, ‘We see.’ Therefore your sin remains.</span> <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="jhn10.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
