    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Then Job answered,</p><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>“Oh that my anguish were weighed,<br/>and all my calamity laid in the balances!<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas,<br/>therefore my words have been rash.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>For the arrows of the Almighty are within me.<br/>My spirit drinks up their poison.<br/>The terrors of God set themselves in array against me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass?<br/>Or does the ox low over his fodder?<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Can that which has no flavor be eaten without salt?<br/>Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>My soul refuses to touch them.<br/>They are as loathsome food to me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>“Oh that I might have my request,<br/>that God would grant the thing that I long for,<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>even that it would please God to crush me;<br/>that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Let it still be my consolation,<br/>yes, let me exult in pain that doesn’t spare,<br/>that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>What is my strength, that I should wait?<br/>What is my end, that I should be patient?<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Is my strength the strength of stones?<br/>Or is my flesh of bronze?<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Isn’t it that I have no help in me,<br/>that wisdom is driven away from me?<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>“To him who is ready to faint, kindness should be shown from his friend;<br/>even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>My brothers have dealt deceitfully as a brook,<br/>as the channel of brooks that pass away;<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>which are black by reason of the ice,<br/>in which the snow hides itself.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>In the dry season, they vanish.<br/>When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>The caravans that travel beside them turn away.<br/>They go up into the waste, and perish.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>The caravans of Tema looked.<br/>The companies of Sheba waited for them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>They were distressed because they were confident.<br/>They came there, and were confounded.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>For now you are nothing.<br/>You see a terror, and are afraid.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Did I ever say, ‘Give to me’?<br/>or, ‘Offer a present for me from your substance’?<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>or, ‘Deliver me from the adversary’s hand’?<br/>or, ‘Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors’?<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>“Teach me, and I will hold my peace.<br/>Cause me to understand my error.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>How forcible are words of uprightness!<br/>But your reproof, what does it reprove?<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>Do you intend to reprove words,<br/>since the speeches of one who is desperate are as wind?<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>Yes, you would even cast lots for the fatherless,<br/>and make merchandise of your friend.<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>Now therefore be pleased to look at me,<br/>for surely I will not lie to your face.<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>Please return.<br/>Let there be no injustice.<br/>Yes, return again.<br/>My cause is righteous.<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>Is there injustice on my tongue?<br/>Can’t my taste discern mischievous things?</p></blockquote></section>
