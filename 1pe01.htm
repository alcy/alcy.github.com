In him, though now you don’t see him, yet believing, you rejoice greatly with joy that is unspeakable and full of glory,   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>receiving the result of your faith, the salvation of your souls.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Concerning this salvation, the prophets sought and searched diligently. They prophesied of the grace that would come to you,   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>searching for who or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them pointed to when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow them.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>To them it was revealed that they served not themselves, but you, in these things, which now have been announced to you through those who preached the Good News to you by the Holy Spirit sent out from heaven; which things angels desire to look into.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Therefore prepare your minds for action.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="1pe-1-13-note-1">
