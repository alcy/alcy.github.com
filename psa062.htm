    <h1>Psalm 62</h1>

    <p class="psalm-subtitle">For the Chief Musician. To Jeduthun. A Psalm by David.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>My soul rests in God alone.<br/>My salvation is from him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>He alone is my rock, my salvation, and my fortress.<br/>I will never be greatly shaken.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>How long will you assault a man?<br/>Would all of you throw him down,<br/>like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>They fully intend to throw him down from his lofty place.<br/>They delight in lies.<br/>They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>My soul, wait in silence for God alone,<br/>for my expectation is from him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress.<br/>I will not be shaken.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>My salvation and my honor is with God.<br/>The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Trust in him at all times, you people.<br/>Pour out your heart before him.<br/>God is a refuge for us.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Surely men of low degree are just a breath,<br/>and men of high degree are a lie.<br/>In the balances they will go up.<br/>They are together lighter than a breath.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Don’t trust in oppression.<br/>Don’t become vain in robbery.<br/>If riches increase,<br/>don’t set your heart on them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>God has spoken once;<br/>twice I have heard this,<br/>that power belongs to God.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Also to you, Lord, belongs loving kindness,<br/>for you reward every man according to his work. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="psa063.htm">→</a></span></p></blockquote></section>
