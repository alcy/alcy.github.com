    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>“The LORD, the God of Israel, says, ‘Write all the words that I have spoken to you in a book.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For, behold, the days come,’ says the LORD, ‘that I will reverse the captivity of my people Israel and Judah,’ says the LORD. ‘I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they will possess it.’ ”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>These are the words that the LORD spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>For the LORD says:</p><blockquote><p>“We have heard a voice of trembling;<br/>a voice of fear, and not of peace.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Ask now, and see whether a man travails with child.<br/>Why do I see every man with his hands on his waist, as a woman in travail,<br/>and all faces are turned pale?<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Alas, for that day is great, so that none is like it!<br/>It is even the time of Jacob’s trouble;<br/>but he will be saved out of it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>It will come to pass in that day, says the LORD of Armies, that I will break his yoke from off your neck,<br/>and will burst your bonds.<br/>Strangers will no more make them their bondservants;<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>but they will serve the LORD their God,<br/>and David their king,<br/>whom I will raise up to them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Therefore don’t be afraid, O Jacob my servant, says the LORD.<br/>Don’t be dismayed, Israel.<br/>For, behold, I will save you from afar,<br/>and save your offspring from the land of their captivity.<br/>Jacob will return,<br/>and will be quiet and at ease.<br/>No one will make him afraid.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>For I am with you, says the LORD, to save you;<br/>for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have scattered you,<br/>but I will not make a full end of you;<br/>but I will correct you in measure,<br/>and will in no way leave you unpunished.”</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>For the LORD says,</p><blockquote><p>“Your hurt is incurable.<br/>Your wound is grievous.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>There is no one to plead your cause,<br/>that you may be bound up.<br/>You have no healing medicines.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>All your lovers have forgotten you.<br/>They don’t seek you.<br/>For I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy,<br/>with the chastisement of a cruel one,<br/>for the greatness of your iniquity,<br/>because your sins were increased.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Why do you cry over your injury?<br/>Your pain is incurable.<br/>For the greatness of your iniquity,<br/>because your sins have increased,<br/>I have done these things to you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Therefore all those who devour you will be devoured.<br/>All your adversaries, everyone of them, will go into captivity.<br/>Those who plunder you will be plunder.<br/>I will make all who prey on you become prey.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>For I will restore health to you,<br/>and I will heal you of your wounds,” says the LORD,<br/>“because they have called you an outcast,<br/>saying, ‘It is Zion, whom no man seeks after.’ ”</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>The LORD says:</p><blockquote><p>“Behold, I will reverse the captivity of Jacob’s tents,<br/>and have compassion on his dwelling places.<br/>The city will be built on its own hill,<br/>and the palace will be inhabited in its own place.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Thanksgiving will proceed out of them<br/>with the voice of those who make merry.<br/>I will multiply them,<br/>and they will not be few;<br/>I will also glorify them,<br/>and they will not be small.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Their children also will be as before,<br/>and their congregation will be established before me.<br/>I will punish all who oppress them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Their prince will be one of them,<br/>and their ruler will proceed from among them.<br/>I will cause him to draw near,<br/>and he will approach me;<br/>for who is he who has had boldness to approach me?” says the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>“You shall be my people,<br/>and I will be your God.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Behold, the LORD’s storm, his wrath, has gone out,<br/>a sweeping storm;<br/>it will burst on the head of the wicked.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>The fierce anger of the LORD will not return until he has accomplished,<br/>and until he has performed the intentions of his heart.<br/>In the latter days you will understand it.”</p></blockquote></section>
