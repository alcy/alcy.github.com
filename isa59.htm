    <h1>Isaiah</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 59</h2>
    
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Behold, the LORD’s hand is not shortened, that it can’t save;<br/>nor his ear dull, that it can’t hear.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>But your iniquities have separated you and your God,<br/>and your sins have hidden his face from you,<br/>so that he will not hear.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For your hands are defiled with blood,<br/>and your fingers with iniquity.<br/>Your lips have spoken lies.<br/>Your tongue mutters wickedness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>No one sues in righteousness,<br/>and no one pleads in truth.<br/>They trust in vanity<br/>and speak lies.<br/>They conceive mischief<br/>and give birth to iniquity.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>They hatch adders’ eggs<br/>and weave the spider’s web.<br/>He who eats of their eggs dies;<br/>and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Their webs won’t become garments.<br/>They won’t cover themselves with their works.<br/>Their works are works of iniquity,<br/>and acts of violence are in their hands.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Their feet run to evil,<br/>and they hurry to shed innocent blood.<br/>Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity.<br/>Desolation and destruction are in their paths.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>They don’t know the way of peace;<br/>and there is no justice in their ways.<br/>They have made crooked paths for themselves;<br/>whoever goes in them doesn’t know peace.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Therefore justice is far from us,<br/>and righteousness doesn’t overtake us.<br/>We look for light, but see darkness;<br/>for brightness, but we walk in obscurity.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>We grope for the wall like the blind.<br/>Yes, we grope as those who have no eyes.<br/>We stumble at noon as if it were twilight.<br/>Among those who are strong, we are like dead men.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>We all roar like bears<br/>and moan sadly like doves.<br/>We look for justice, but there is none,<br/>for salvation, but it is far off from us.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>For our transgressions are multiplied before you,<br/>and our sins testify against us;<br/>for our transgressions are with us,<br/>and as for our iniquities, we know them:<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>transgressing and denying the LORD,<br/>and turning away from following our God,<br/>speaking oppression and revolt,<br/>conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Justice is turned away backward,<br/>and righteousness stands far away;<br/>for truth has fallen in the street,<br/>and uprightness can’t enter.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Yes, truth is lacking;<br/>and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey.<br/>The LORD saw it,<br/>and it displeased him that there was no justice.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>He saw that there was no man,<br/>and wondered that there was no intercessor.<br/>Therefore his own arm brought salvation to him;<br/>and his righteousness sustained him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>He put on righteousness as a breastplate,<br/>and a helmet of salvation on his head.<br/>He put on garments of vengeance for clothing,<br/>and was clad with zeal as a mantle.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>According to their deeds,<br/>he will repay as appropriate:<br/>wrath to his adversaries,<br/>recompense to his enemies.<br/>He will repay the islands their due.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>So they will fear the LORD’s name from the west,<br/>and his glory from the rising of the sun;<br/>for he will come as a rushing stream,<br/>which the LORD’s breath drives.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>“A Redeemer will come to Zion,<br/>and to those who turn from disobedience in Jacob,” says the LORD.</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>“As for me, this is my covenant with them,” says the LORD. “My Spirit who is on you, and my words which I have put in your mouth shall not depart out of your mouth, nor out of the mouth of your offspring, nor out of the mouth of your offspring’s offspring,” says the LORD, “from now on and forever.”</p></section>
