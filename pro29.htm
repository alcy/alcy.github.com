    <h2>Chapter 29</h2>
    
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>He who is often rebuked and stiffens his neck<br/>will be destroyed suddenly, with no remedy.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>When the righteous thrive, the people rejoice;<br/>but when the wicked rule, the people groan.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Whoever loves wisdom brings joy to his father;<br/>but a companion of prostitutes squanders his wealth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>The king by justice makes the land stable,<br/>but he who takes bribes tears it down.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>A man who flatters his neighbor<br/>spreads a net for his feet.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>An evil man is snared by his sin,<br/>but the righteous can sing and be glad.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>The righteous care about justice for the poor.<br/>The wicked aren’t concerned about knowledge.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Mockers stir up a city,<br/>but wise men turn away anger.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>If a wise man goes to court with a foolish man,<br/>the fool rages or scoffs, and there is no peace.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>The bloodthirsty hate a man of integrity;<br/>and they seek the life of the upright.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>A fool vents all of his anger,<br/>but a wise man brings himself under control.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>If a ruler listens to lies,<br/>all of his officials are wicked.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>The poor man and the oppressor have this in common:<br/>The LORD gives sight to the eyes of both.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>The king who fairly judges the poor,<br/>his throne shall be established forever.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>The rod of correction gives wisdom,<br/>but a child left to himself causes shame to his mother.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>When the wicked increase, sin increases;<br/>but the righteous will see their downfall.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Correct your son, and he will give you peace;<br/>yes, he will bring delight to your soul.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint;<br/>but one who keeps the law is blessed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>A servant can’t be corrected by words.<br/>Though he understands, yet he will not respond.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Do you see a man who is hasty in his words?<br/>There is more hope for a fool than for him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>He who pampers his servant from youth<br/>will have him become a son in the end.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>An angry man stirs up strife,<br/>and a wrathful man abounds in sin.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>A man’s pride brings him low,<br/>but one of lowly spirit gains honor.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Whoever is an accomplice of a thief is an enemy of his own soul.<br/>He takes an oath, but dares not testify.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>The fear of man proves to be a snare,<br/>but whoever puts his trust in the LORD is kept safe.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>Many seek the ruler’s favor,<br/>but a man’s justice comes from the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>A dishonest man detests the righteous,<br/>and the upright in their ways detest the wicked. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="pro30.htm">→</a></span></p></blockquote></section>
