    <h1>Psalm 58</h1>

    <p class="psalm-subtitle">For the Chief Musician. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” A poem by David.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Do you indeed speak righteousness, silent ones?<br/>Do you judge blamelessly, you sons of men?<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>No, in your heart you plot injustice.<br/>You measure out the violence of your hands in the earth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>The wicked go astray from the womb.<br/>They are wayward as soon as they are born, speaking lies.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Their poison is like the poison of a snake,<br/>like a deaf cobra that stops its ear,<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>which doesn’t listen to the voice of charmers,<br/>no matter how skillful the charmer may be.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Break their teeth, God, in their mouth.<br/>Break out the great teeth of the young lions, LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Let them vanish like water that flows away.<br/>When they draw the bow, let their arrows be made blunt.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Let them be like a snail which melts and passes away,<br/>like the stillborn child, who has not seen the sun.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns,<br/>he will sweep away the green and the burning alike.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance.<br/>He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked,<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>so that men shall say, “Most certainly there is a reward for the righteous.<br/>Most certainly there is a God who judges the earth.”</p></blockquote></section>
