    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same things to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn’t crowned unless he has competed by the rules.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>The farmer who labors must be the first to get a share of the crops.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the offspring<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="2ti-2-8-note-1">

        or, seed
        </span> of David, according to my Good News,   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God’s word isn’t chained.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones’ sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>This saying is trustworthy:</p><blockquote><p>“For if we died with him,<br/>we will also live with him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>If we endure,<br/>we will also reign with him.<br/>If we deny him,<br/>he also will deny us.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>If we are faithless,<br/>he remains faithful;<br/>for he can’t deny himself.”</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord that they don’t argue about words to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn’t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>But shun empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness,   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>and those words will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus:   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some.   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>However, God’s firm foundation stands, having this seal: “The Lord knows those who are his,”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="2ti-2-19-note-1">

Some are for honor and some for dishonor.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master’s use, prepared for every good work.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife.   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>The Lord’s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle toward all, able to teach, patient,   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>in gentleness correcting those who oppose him. Perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth,   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>and they may recover themselves out of the devil’s snare, having been taken captive by him to do his will. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="2ti03.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
