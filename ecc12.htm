    <h1>Ecclesiastes</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth,</p><blockquote><p>before the evil days come, and the years draw near,<br/>when you will say, “I have no pleasure in them;”<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Before the sun, the light, the moon, and the stars are darkened,<br/>and the clouds return after the rain;<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble,<br/>and the strong men shall bow themselves,<br/>and the grinders cease because they are few,<br/>and those who look out of the windows are darkened,<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>and the doors shall be shut in the street;<br/>when the sound of the grinding is low,<br/>and one shall rise up at the voice of a bird,<br/>and all the daughters of music shall be brought low;<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>yes, they shall be afraid of heights,<br/>and terrors will be on the way;<br/>and the almond tree shall blossom,<br/>and the grasshopper shall be a burden,<br/>and desire shall fail;<br/>because man goes to his everlasting home,<br/>and the mourners go about the streets;<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>before the silver cord is severed,<br/>or the golden bowl is broken,<br/>or the pitcher is broken at the spring,<br/>or the wheel broken at the cistern,<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>and the dust returns to the earth as it was,<br/>and the spirit returns to God who gave it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>“Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher.<br/>“All is vanity!”</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Further, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge. Yes, he pondered, sought out, and set in order many proverbs.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words, and that which was written blamelessly, words of truth.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>The words of the wise are like goads; and like nails well fastened are words from the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Furthermore, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>This is the end of the matter. All has been heard. Fear God and keep his commandments; for this is the whole duty of man.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>For God will bring every work into judgment, with every hidden thing, whether it is good, or whether it is evil.</p></section>
