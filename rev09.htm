The sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke from the pit.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Then out of the smoke came locusts on the earth, and power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>They were told that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only those people who don’t have God’s seal on their foreheads.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>They were given power, not to kill them, but to torment them for five months. Their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a person.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>In those days people will seek death, and will in no way find it. They will desire to die, and death will flee from them.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>The shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for war. On their heads were something like golden crowns, and their faces were like people’s faces.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>They had hair like women’s hair, and their teeth were like those of lions.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>They had breastplates like breastplates of iron. The sound of their wings was like the sound of many chariots and horses rushing to war.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>They have tails like those of scorpions, with stingers. In their tails they have power to harm men for five months.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>They have over them as king the angel of the abyss.

        “Abaddon” is a Hebrew word that means “ruin”, “destruction”, or “the place of destruction”

Out of their mouths proceed fire, smoke, and sulfur.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>By these three plagues, one third of mankind was killed: by the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur, which proceeded out of their mouths.   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails. For their tails are like serpents, and have heads; and with them they harm.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>The rest of mankind, who were not killed with these plagues, didn’t repent of the works of their hands, that they wouldn’t worship demons, and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood, which can’t see, hear, or walk.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>They didn’t repent of their murders, their sorceries,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="rev-9-21-note-1">
