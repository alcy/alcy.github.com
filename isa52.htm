    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Awake, awake! Put on your strength, Zion.<br/>Put on your beautiful garments, Jerusalem, the holy city,<br/>for from now on the uncircumcised and the unclean will no more come into you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Shake yourself from the dust!<br/>Arise, sit up, Jerusalem!<br/>Release yourself from the bonds of your neck, captive daughter of Zion!<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For the LORD says, “You were sold for nothing;<br/>and you will be redeemed without money.”</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>For the Lord GOD says:</p><blockquote><p>“My people went down at the first into Egypt to live there;<br/>and the Assyrian has oppressed them without cause.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>“Now therefore, what do I do here,” says the LORD,<br/>“seeing that my people are taken away for nothing?<br/>Those who rule over them mock,” says the LORD,<br/>“and my name is blasphemed continually all day long.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Therefore my people shall know my name.<br/>Therefore they shall know in that day that I am he who speaks.<br/>Behold, it is I.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news,<br/>who publishes peace,<br/>who brings good news,<br/>who proclaims salvation,<br/>who says to Zion, “Your God reigns!”<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Your watchmen lift up their voice.<br/>Together they sing;<br/>for they shall see eye to eye when the LORD returns to Zion.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Break out into joy!<br/>Sing together, you waste places of Jerusalem;<br/>for the LORD has comforted his people.<br/>He has redeemed Jerusalem.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>The LORD has made his holy arm bare in the eyes of all the nations.<br/>All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Depart! Depart! Go out from there! Touch no unclean thing!<br/>Go out from among her!<br/>Cleanse yourselves, you who carry the LORD’s vessels.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>For you shall not go out in haste,<br/>neither shall you go by flight;<br/>for the LORD will go before you,<br/>and the God of Israel will be your rear guard.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Behold, my servant will deal wisely.<br/>He will be exalted and lifted up,<br/>and will be very high.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Just as many were astonished at you—<br/>his appearance was marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men—<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>so he will cleanse<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="isa-52-15-note-1">
