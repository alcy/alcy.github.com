    <h1>The Proverbs</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 21</h2>
    
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>The king’s heart is in the LORD’s hand like the watercourses.<br/>He turns it wherever he desires.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Every way of a man is right in his own eyes,<br/>but the LORD weighs the hearts.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>To do righteousness and justice<br/>is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>A high look and a proud heart,<br/>the lamp of the wicked, is sin.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>The plans of the diligent surely lead to profit;<br/>and everyone who is hasty surely rushes to poverty.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Getting treasures by a lying tongue<br/>is a fleeting vapor for those who seek death.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>The violence of the wicked will drive them away,<br/>because they refuse to do what is right.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>The way of the guilty is devious,<br/>but the conduct of the innocent is upright.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop<br/>than to share a house with a contentious woman.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>The soul of the wicked desires evil;<br/>his neighbor finds no mercy in his eyes.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>When the mocker is punished, the simple gains wisdom.<br/>When the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>The Righteous One considers the house of the wicked,<br/>and brings the wicked to ruin.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor,<br/>he will also cry out, but shall not be heard.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>A gift in secret pacifies anger,<br/>and a bribe in the cloak, strong wrath.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>It is joy to the righteous to do justice;<br/>but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>The man who wanders out of the way of understanding<br/>shall rest in the assembly of the departed spirits.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>He who loves pleasure will be a poor man.<br/>He who loves wine and oil won’t be rich.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>The wicked is a ransom for the righteous,<br/>the treacherous for the upright.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>It is better to dwell in a desert land,<br/>than with a contentious and fretful woman.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise,<br/>but a foolish man swallows it up.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>He who follows after righteousness and kindness<br/>finds life, righteousness, and honor.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>A wise man scales the city of the mighty,<br/>and brings down the strength of its confidence.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Whoever guards his mouth and his tongue<br/>keeps his soul from troubles.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>The proud and arrogant man—“Scoffer” is his name—<br/>he works in the arrogance of pride.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>The desire of the sluggard kills him,<br/>for his hands refuse to labor.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>There are those who covet greedily all day long;<br/>but the righteous give and don’t withhold.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination—<br/>how much more, when he brings it with a wicked mind!<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>A false witness will perish.<br/>A man who listens speaks to eternity.<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>A wicked man hardens his face;<br/>but as for the upright, he establishes his ways.<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>There is no wisdom nor understanding<br/>nor counsel against the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>The horse is prepared for the day of battle;<br/>but victory is with the LORD. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="pro22.htm">→</a></span></p></blockquote></section>
