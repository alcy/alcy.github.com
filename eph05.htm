    <h1>Paul's Letter to the Ephesians</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Walk in love, even as Christ also loved us and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling fragrance.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>But sexual immorality, and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not even be mentioned among you, as becomes saints;   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not appropriate, but rather giving of thanks.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Know this for sure, that no sexually immoral person, nor unclean person, nor covetous man (who is an idolater), has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and God.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Therefore don’t be partakers with them.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>For you were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord. Walk as children of light,   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth,   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>proving what is well pleasing to the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Have no fellowship with the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but rather even reprove them.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>For it is a shame even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>But all things, when they are reproved, are revealed by the light, for everything that reveals is light.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Therefore he says, “Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Therefore watch carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise,   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>redeeming the time, because the days are evil.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Therefore, don’t be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Don’t be drunken with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>giving thanks always concerning all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>subjecting yourselves to one another in the fear of Christ.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the assembly, being himself the savior of the body.   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>But as the assembly is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their own husbands in everything.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the assembly and gave himself up for her,   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,   <span class="verse" id="V27"></span>that he might present the assembly to himself gloriously, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without defect.   <span class="verse" id="V28"></span>Even so husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself.   <span class="verse" id="V29"></span>For no man ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord also does the assembly,   <span class="verse" id="V30"></span>because we are members of his body, of his flesh and bones.   <span class="verse" id="V31"></span>“For this cause a man will leave his father and mother and will be joined to his wife. Then the two will become one flesh.”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="eph-5-31-note-1">

<a href="gen02.htm#v24">Genesis 2:24</a>
</span> <span class="verse" id="V32"></span>This mystery is great, but I speak concerning Christ and the assembly.   <span class="verse" id="V33"></span>Nevertheless each of you must also love his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she respects her husband.</p></section>
