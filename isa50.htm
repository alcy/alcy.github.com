    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>The LORD says, “Where is the bill of your mother’s divorce, with which I have put her away?<br/>Or to which of my creditors have I sold you?<br/>Behold, you were sold for your iniquities,<br/>and your mother was put away for your transgressions.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Why, when I came, was there no one?<br/>When I called, why was there no one to answer?<br/>Is my hand shortened at all, that it can’t redeem?<br/>Or have I no power to deliver?<br/>Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea.<br/>I make the rivers a wilderness.<br/>Their fish stink because there is no water, and die of thirst.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>I clothe the heavens with blackness.<br/>I make sackcloth their covering.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of those who are taught,<br/>that I may know how to sustain with words him who is weary.<br/>He awakens morning by morning,<br/>he awakens my ear to hear as those who are taught.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>The Lord GOD has opened my ear.<br/>I was not rebellious.<br/>I have not turned back.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>I gave my back to those who beat me,<br/>and my cheeks to those who plucked off the hair.<br/>I didn’t hide my face from shame and spitting.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>For the Lord GOD will help me.<br/>Therefore I have not been confounded.<br/>Therefore I have set my face like a flint,<br/>and I know that I won’t be disappointed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>He who justifies me is near.<br/>Who will bring charges against me?<br/>Let us stand up together.<br/>Who is my adversary?<br/>Let him come near to me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Behold, the Lord GOD will help me!<br/>Who is he who will condemn me?<br/>Behold, they will all grow old like a garment.<br/>The moths will eat them up.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Who among you fears the LORD<br/>and obeys the voice of his servant?<br/>He who walks in darkness<br/>and has no light,<br/>let him trust in the LORD’s name,<br/>and rely on his God.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Behold, all you who kindle a fire,<br/>who adorn yourselves with torches around yourselves,<br/>walk in the flame of your fire,<br/>and among the torches that you have kindled.<br/>You will have this from my hand:<br/>you will lie down in sorrow. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="isa51.htm">→</a></span></p></blockquote></section>
