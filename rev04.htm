    <h1>The Revelation to John</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>After these things I looked and saw a door opened in heaven; and the first voice that I heard, like a trumpet speaking with me, was one saying, “Come up here, and I will show you the things which must happen after this.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Immediately I was in the Spirit. Behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting on the throne   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>that looked like a jasper stone and a sardius. There was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald to look at.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Around the throne were twenty-four thrones. On the thrones were twenty-four elders sitting, dressed in white garments, with crowns of gold on their heads.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Out of the throne proceed lightnings, sounds, and thunders. There were seven lamps of fire burning before his throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Before the throne was something like a sea of glass, similar to crystal. In the middle of the throne, and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>The first creature was like a lion, the second creature like a calf, the third creature had a face like a man, and the fourth was like a flying eagle.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>The four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes around and within. They have no rest day and night, saying, “Holy, holy, holy<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="rev-4-8-note-1">
