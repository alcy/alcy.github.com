    <h1>Psalm 14</h1>

    <p class="psalm-subtitle">For the Chief Musician. By David.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.”<br/>They are corrupt.<br/>They have done abominable deeds.<br/>There is no one who does good.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>The LORD looked down from heaven on the children of men,<br/>to see if there were any who understood,<br/>who sought after God.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>They have all gone aside.<br/>They have together become corrupt.<br/>There is no one who does good, no, not one.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge,<br/>who eat up my people as they eat bread,<br/>and don’t call on the LORD?<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>There they were in great fear,<br/>for God is in the generation of the righteous.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>You frustrate the plan of the poor,<br/>because the LORD is his refuge.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!<br/>When the LORD restores the fortunes of his people,<br/>then Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.</p></blockquote></section>
