    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Oh come, let’s sing to the LORD.<br/>Let’s shout aloud to the rock of our salvation!<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Let’s come before his presence with thanksgiving.<br/>Let’s extol him with songs!<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For the LORD is a great God,<br/>a great King above all gods.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>In his hand are the deep places of the earth.<br/>The heights of the mountains are also his.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>The sea is his, and he made it.<br/>His hands formed the dry land.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Oh come, let’s worship and bow down.<br/>Let’s kneel before the LORD, our Maker,<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>for he is our God.<br/>We are the people of his pasture,<br/>and the sheep in his care.<br/>Today, oh that you would hear his voice!<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Don’t harden your heart, as at Meribah,<br/>as in the day of Massah in the wilderness,<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>when your fathers tempted me,<br/>tested me, and saw my work.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Forty long years I was grieved with that generation,<br/>and said, “They are a people who err in their heart.<br/>They have not known my ways.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Therefore I swore in my wrath,<br/>“They won’t enter into my rest.”</p></blockquote></section>
