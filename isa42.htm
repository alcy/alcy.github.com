    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>“Behold, my servant, whom I uphold,<br/>my chosen, in whom my soul delights:<br/>I have put my Spirit on him.<br/>He will bring justice to the nations.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>He will not shout,<br/>nor raise his voice,<br/>nor cause it to be heard in the street.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>He won’t break a bruised reed.<br/>He won’t quench a dimly burning wick.<br/>He will faithfully bring justice.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>He will not fail nor be discouraged,<br/>until he has set justice in the earth,<br/>and the islands wait for his law.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>God the LORD,<br/>he who created the heavens and stretched them out,<br/>he who spread out the earth and that which comes out of it,<br/>he who gives breath to its people and spirit to those who walk in it, says:<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>“I, the LORD, have called you in righteousness.<br/>I will hold your hand.<br/>I will keep you,<br/>and make you a covenant for the people,<br/>as a light for the nations,<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>to open the blind eyes,<br/>to bring the prisoners out of the dungeon,<br/>and those who sit in darkness out of the prison.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>“I am the LORD.<br/>That is my name.<br/>I will not give my glory to another,<br/>nor my praise to engraved images.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Behold, the former things have happened<br/>and I declare new things.<br/>I tell you about them before they come up.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Sing to the LORD a new song,<br/>and his praise from the end of the earth,<br/>you who go down to the sea,<br/>and all that is therein,<br/>the islands and their inhabitants.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Let the wilderness and its cities raise their voices,<br/>with the villages that Kedar inhabits.<br/>Let the inhabitants of Sela sing.<br/>Let them shout from the top of the mountains!<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Let them give glory to the LORD,<br/>and declare his praise in the islands.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>The LORD will go out like a mighty man.<br/>He will stir up zeal like a man of war.<br/>He will raise a war cry.<br/>Yes, he will shout aloud.<br/>He will triumph over his enemies.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>“I have been silent a long time.<br/>I have been quiet and restrained myself.<br/>Now I will cry out like a travailing woman. I will both gasp and pant.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>I will destroy mountains and hills,<br/>and dry up all their herbs.<br/>I will make the rivers islands,<br/>and will dry up the pools.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>I will bring the blind by a way that they don’t know.<br/>I will lead them in paths that they don’t know.<br/>I will make darkness light before them,<br/>and crooked places straight.<br/>I will do these things,<br/>and I will not forsake them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>“Those who trust in engraved images,<br/>who tell molten images,<br/>‘You are our gods,’<br/>will be turned back.<br/>They will be utterly disappointed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>“Hear, you deaf,<br/>and look, you blind,<br/>that you may see.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Who is blind, but my servant?<br/>Or who is as deaf as my messenger whom I send?<br/>Who is as blind as he who is at peace,<br/>and as blind as the LORD’s servant?<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>You see many things, but don’t observe.<br/>His ears are open, but he doesn’t listen.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>It pleased the LORD, for his righteousness’ sake, to magnify the law<br/>and make it honorable.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>But this is a robbed and plundered people.<br/>All of them are snared in holes,<br/>and they are hidden in prisons.<br/>They have become captives, and no one delivers,<br/>and a plunder, and no one says, ‘Restore them!’<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Who is there among you who will give ear to this?<br/>Who will listen and hear for the time to come?<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Who gave Jacob as plunder,<br/>and Israel to the robbers?<br/>Didn’t the LORD, he against whom we have sinned?<br/>For they would not walk in his ways,<br/>and they disobeyed his law.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>Therefore he poured the fierceness of his anger on him,<br/>and the strength of battle.<br/>It set him on fire all around, but he didn’t know.<br/>It burned him, but he didn’t take it to heart.”</p></blockquote></section>
