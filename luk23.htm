He hoped to see some miracle done by him.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>He questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>and said to them, “You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and behold, having examined him before you, I found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Neither has Herod, for I sent you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>I will therefore chastise him and release him.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="luk-23-17-note-1">

Release to us Barabbas!”—   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release Jesus,   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>but they shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify him!”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>He said to them the third time, “Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him.”   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed.   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done.   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus up to their will.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>When they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid the cross on him to carry it after Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V27"></span>A great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him.   <span class="verse" id="V28"></span>But Jesus, turning to them, said, <span class="wj">“Daughters of Jerusalem, don’t weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. </span> <span class="verse" id="V29"></span><span class="wj">For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.’ </span> <span class="verse" id="V30"></span><span class="wj">Then they will begin to tell the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and tell the hills, ‘Cover us.’</span><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="luk-23-30-note-1">
