    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>He began to speak to them in parables. <span class="wj">“A man planted a vineyard, put a hedge around it, dug a pit for the wine press, built a tower, rented it out to a farmer, and went into another country. </span> <span class="verse" id="V2"></span><span class="wj">When it was time, he sent a servant to the farmer to get from the farmer his share of the fruit of the vineyard. </span> <span class="verse" id="V3"></span><span class="wj">They took him, beat him, and sent him away empty. </span> <span class="verse" id="V4"></span><span class="wj">Again, he sent another servant to them; and they threw stones at him, wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully treated. </span> <span class="verse" id="V5"></span><span class="wj">Again he sent another, and they killed him, and many others, beating some, and killing some. </span> <span class="verse" id="V6"></span><span class="wj">Therefore still having one, his beloved son, he sent him last to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ </span> <span class="verse" id="V7"></span><span class="wj">But those farmers said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’ </span> <span class="verse" id="V8"></span><span class="wj">They took him, killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard. </span> <span class="verse" id="V9"></span><span class="wj">What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers, and will give the vineyard to others. </span> <span class="verse" id="V10"></span><span class="wj">Haven’t you even read this Scripture:</span></p><blockquote><p><span class="wj">‘The stone which the builders rejected</span><br/><span class="wj">was made the head of the corner.</span><br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span><span class="wj">This was from the Lord.</span><br/><span class="wj">It is marvelous in our eyes’?”</span><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="mrk-12-11-note-1">

</span></p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>They tried to seize him, but they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spoke the parable against them. They left him and went away.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>They sent some of the Pharisees and the Herodians to him, that they might trap him with words.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>When they had come, they asked him, “Teacher, we know that you are honest, and don’t defer to anyone; for you aren’t partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Shall we give, or shall we not give?”</p><p>But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, <span class="wj">“Why do you test me? Bring me a denarius, that I may see it.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>They brought it.</p><p>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Whose is this image and inscription?”</span></p><p>They said to him, “Caesar’s.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Jesus answered them, <span class="wj">“Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”</span></p><p>They marveled greatly at him.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Some Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, came to him. They asked him, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>“Teacher, Moses wrote to us, ‘If a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife behind him, and leaves no children, that his brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his brother.’   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>There were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and dying left no offspring.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>The second took her, and died, leaving no children behind him. The third likewise;   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>and the seven took her and left no children. Last of all the woman also died.   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>In the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be of them? For the seven had her as a wife.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Jesus answered them, <span class="wj">“Isn’t this because you are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God? </span> <span class="verse" id="V25"></span><span class="wj">For when they will rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. </span> <span class="verse" id="V26"></span><span class="wj">But about the dead, that they are raised, haven’t you read in the book of Moses about the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?</span><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="mrk-12-26-note-1">
