    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Moreover Elihu answered,</p><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>“Hear my words, you wise men.<br/>Give ear to me, you who have knowledge.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For the ear tries words,<br/>as the palate tastes food.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Let us choose for us that which is right.<br/>Let us know among ourselves what is good.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>For Job has said, ‘I am righteous,<br/>God has taken away my right.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Notwithstanding my right I am considered a liar.<br/>My wound is incurable, though I am without disobedience.’<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>What man is like Job,<br/>who drinks scorn like water,<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>who goes in company with the workers of iniquity,<br/>and walks with wicked men?<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>For he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing<br/>that he should delight himself with God.’<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>“Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding:<br/>far be it from God, that he should do wickedness,<br/>from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>For the work of a man he will give to him,<br/>and cause every man to find according to his ways.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Yes surely, God will not do wickedly,<br/>neither will the Almighty pervert justice.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Who put him in charge of the earth?<br/>Or who has appointed him over the whole world?<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>If he set his heart on himself,<br/>if he gathered to himself his spirit and his breath,<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>all flesh would perish together,<br/>and man would turn again to dust.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>“If now you have understanding, hear this.<br/>Listen to the voice of my words.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Should even one who hates justice govern?<br/>Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty,<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>who says to a king, ‘Vile!’<br/>or to nobles, ‘Wicked!’?<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>He doesn’t respect the persons of princes,<br/>nor respect the rich more than the poor,<br/>for they all are the work of his hands.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>In a moment they die, even at midnight.<br/>The people are shaken and pass away.<br/>The mighty are taken away without a hand.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>“For his eyes are on the ways of a man.<br/>He sees all his goings.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>There is no darkness, nor thick gloom,<br/>where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>For he doesn’t need to consider a man further,<br/>that he should go before God in judgment.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>He breaks mighty men in pieces in ways past finding out,<br/>and sets others in their place.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>Therefore he takes knowledge of their works.<br/>He overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>He strikes them as wicked men<br/>in the open sight of others;<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>because they turned away from following him,<br/>and wouldn’t pay attention to any of his ways,<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him.<br/>He heard the cry of the afflicted.<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>When he gives quietness, who then can condemn?<br/>When he hides his face, who then can see him?<br/>He is over a nation or a man alike,<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>that the godless man may not reign,<br/>that there be no one to ensnare the people.<br/><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>“For has any said to God,<br/>‘I am guilty, but I will not offend any more.<br/><span class="verse" id="V32"></span>Teach me that which I don’t see.<br/>If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more’?<br/><span class="verse" id="V33"></span>Shall his recompense be as you desire, that you refuse it?<br/>For you must choose, and not I.<br/>Therefore speak what you know.<br/><span class="verse" id="V34"></span>Men of understanding will tell me,<br/>yes, every wise man who hears me:<br/><span class="verse" id="V35"></span>‘Job speaks without knowledge.<br/>His words are without wisdom.’<br/><span class="verse" id="V36"></span>I wish that Job were tried to the end,<br/>because of his answering like wicked men.<br/><span class="verse" id="V37"></span>For he adds rebellion to his sin.<br/>He claps his hands among us,<br/>and multiplies his words against God.”</p></blockquote></section>
