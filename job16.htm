This is a witness against me.<br/>My leanness rises up against me.<br/>It testifies to my face.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>He has torn me in his wrath and persecuted me.<br/>He has gnashed on me with his teeth.<br/>My adversary sharpens his eyes on me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>They have gaped on me with their mouth.<br/>They have struck me on the cheek reproachfully.<br/>They gather themselves together against me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>God delivers me to the ungodly,<br/>and casts me into the hands of the wicked.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>I was at ease, and he broke me apart.<br/>Yes, he has taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces.<br/>He has also set me up for his target.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>His archers surround me.<br/>He splits my kidneys apart, and does not spare.<br/>He pours out my bile on the ground.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>He breaks me with breach on breach.<br/>He runs at me like a giant.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>I have sewed sackcloth on my skin,<br/>and have thrust my horn in the dust.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>My face is red with weeping.<br/>Deep darkness is on my eyelids,<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>although there is no violence in my hands,<br/>and my prayer is pure.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>“Earth, don’t cover my blood.<br/>Let my cry have no place to rest.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven.<br/>He who vouches for me is on high.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>My friends scoff at me.<br/>My eyes pour out tears to God,<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>that he would maintain the right of a man with God,<br/>of a son of man with his neighbor!<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>For when a few years have come,<br/>I will go the way of no return. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="job17.htm">→</a></span></p></blockquote></section>
