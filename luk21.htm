There will be terrors and great signs from heaven. </span> <span class="verse" id="V12"></span><span class="wj">But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you up to synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for my name’s sake. </span> <span class="verse" id="V13"></span><span class="wj">It will turn out as a testimony for you. </span> <span class="verse" id="V14"></span><span class="wj">Settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate beforehand how to answer, </span> <span class="verse" id="V15"></span><span class="wj">for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to withstand or to contradict. </span> <span class="verse" id="V16"></span><span class="wj">You will be handed over even by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends. They will cause some of you to be put to death. </span> <span class="verse" id="V17"></span><span class="wj">You will be hated by all men for my name’s sake. </span> <span class="verse" id="V18"></span><span class="wj">And not a hair of your head will perish.</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V19"></span><span class="wj">“By your endurance you will win your lives.</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V20"></span><span class="wj">“But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is at hand. </span> <span class="verse" id="V21"></span><span class="wj">Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let those who are in the middle of her depart. Let those who are in the country not enter therein. </span> <span class="verse" id="V22"></span><span class="wj">For these are days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled. </span> <span class="verse" id="V23"></span><span class="wj">Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse infants in those days! For there will be great distress in the land and wrath to this people. </span> <span class="verse" id="V24"></span><span class="wj">They will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations.
