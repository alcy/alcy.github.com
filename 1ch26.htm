    <h1>The First Book of Chronicles</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 26</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>For the divisions of the doorkeepers: of the
            Korahites, Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph. <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Meshelemiah had sons: Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the
            third, Jathniel the fourth, <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth,
            and Eliehoenai the seventh. <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Obed-Edom had sons: Shemaiah the
            firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, Sacar the fourth, Nethanel the fifth, <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, and Peullethai the eighth; for God blessed
            him. <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Sons were also born to Shemaiah his son, who ruled over the
            house of their father; for they were mighty men of valor. <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>The sons
            of Shemaiah: Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad, whose relatives were valiant men, Elihu, and Semachiah.
            <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>All these were of the sons of Obed-Edom with their sons and their
            brothers, able men in strength for the service: sixty-two of Obed-Edom. <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Meshelemiah had sons and brothers, eighteen valiant men. <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons: Shimri the chief (for though he
            was not the firstborn, yet his father made him chief), <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Hilkiah
            the second, Tebaliah the third, and Zechariah the fourth. All the sons and brothers of Hosah were thirteen.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Of these were the divisions of the doorkeepers, even
            of the chief men, having offices like their brothers, to minister in the LORD’s house. <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>They cast lots, the small as well as the great, according to their fathers’
            houses, for every gate. <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>The lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then
            for Zechariah his son, a wise counselor, they cast lots; and his lot came out northward. <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>To Obed-Edom southward; and to his sons the storehouse. <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>To Shuppim and Hosah westward, by the gate of Shallecheth, at the causeway that
            goes up, watchman opposite watchman. <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Eastward were six Levites,
            northward four a day, southward four a day, and for the storehouse two and two. <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>For Parbar westward, four at the causeway, and two at Parbar. <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>These were the divisions of the doorkeepers; of the sons of the
            Korahites, and of the sons of Merari.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasures of
            God’s house and over the treasures of the dedicated things. <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>The
            sons of Ladan, the sons of the Gershonites belonging to Ladan, the heads of the fathers’ households
            belonging to Ladan the Gershonite: Jehieli. <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>The sons of Jehieli:
            Zetham, and Joel his brother, over the treasures of the LORD’s house. <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Of the Amramites, of the Izharites, of the Hebronites, of the Uzzielites: <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler over the
            treasuries. <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>His brothers: of Eliezer, Rehabiah his son, and
            Jeshaiah his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomoth his son. <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>This Shelomoth and his brothers were over all the treasuries of the dedicated
            things, which David the king, and the heads of the fathers’ households, the captains over thousands and
            hundreds, and the captains of the army, had dedicated. <span class="verse" id="V27"></span>They
            dedicated some of the plunder won in battles to repair the LORD’s house. <span class="verse" id="V28"></span>All that Samuel the seer, Saul the son of Kish, Abner the son of Ner, and Joab
            the son of Zeruiah had dedicated, whoever had dedicated anything, it was under the hand of Shelomoth and of
            his brothers.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were
            appointed to the outward business over Israel, for officers and judges. <span class="verse" id="V30"></span>Of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brothers, one thousand seven hundred men of
            valor, had the oversight of Israel beyond the Jordan westward, for all the business of the LORD and for the
            service of the king. <span class="verse" id="V31"></span>Of the Hebronites, Jerijah was the chief of
            the Hebronites, according to their generations by fathers’ households. They were sought for in the fortieth
            year of the reign of David, and mighty men of valor were found among them at Jazer of Gilead. <span class="verse" id="V32"></span>His relatives, men of valor, were two thousand seven hundred,
            heads of fathers’ households, whom King David made overseers over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the
            half-tribe of the Manassites, for every matter pertaining to God and for the affairs of the king. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="1ch27.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
