He was a skilled scribe in the law of Moses, which the LORD, the God of Israel, had given; and the king granted him all his request, according to the LORD his God’s hand on him.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Some of the children of Israel, including some of the priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants went up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>He came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>For on the first day of the first month he began to go up from Babylon; and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God on him.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>For Ezra had set his heart to seek the LORD’s law, and to do it, and to teach statutes and ordinances in Israel.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Now this is the copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, even the scribe of the words of the LORD’s commandments, and of his statutes to Israel:</p><p>Now   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>I make a decree that all those of the people of Israel and their priests and the Levites in my realm, who intend of their own free will to go to Jerusalem, go with you.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Because you are sent by the king and his seven counselors to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of your God which is in your hand,   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>and to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem,   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>and all the silver and gold that you will find in all the province of Babylon, with the free will offering of the people and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Therefore you shall with all diligence buy with this money bulls, rams, and lambs with their meal offerings and their drink offerings, and shall offer them on the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Whatever seems good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, do that according to the will of your God.   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>The vessels that are given to you for the service of the house of your God, deliver before the God of Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Whatever more will be needed for the house of your God, which you may have occasion to give, give it out of the king’s treasure house.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>I, even I, Artaxerxes the king, make a decree to all the treasurers who are beyond the River, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, requires of you, it shall be done with all diligence,   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>up to one hundred talents<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="ezr-7-22-note-1">
