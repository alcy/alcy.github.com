She shall not touch any holy thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying are completed.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>But if she bears a female child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her period; and she shall continue in the blood of purification sixty-six days.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>“ ‘When the days of her purification are completed for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the door of the Tent of Meeting, a year old lamb for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon or a turtledove, for a sin offering.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>He shall offer it before the LORD, and make atonement for her; then she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood.</p><p>“ ‘This is the law for her who bears, whether a male or a female.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>If she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves or two young pigeons: the one for a burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering. The priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean.’ ” <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="lev13.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
