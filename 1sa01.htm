    <h1>The First Book of Samuel</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim, of the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>He had two wives. The name of one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>This man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="1sa-1-3-note-1">

        </span> of Armies in Shiloh. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to the LORD, were there.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters;   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>but he gave a double portion to Hannah, for he loved Hannah, but the LORD had shut up her womb.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Her rival provoked her severely, to irritate her, because the LORD had shut up her womb.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>So year by year, when she went up to the LORD’s house, her rival provoked her. Therefore she wept, and didn’t eat.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Elkanah her husband said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep? Why don’t you eat? Why is your heart grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>So Hannah rose up after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of the LORD’s temple.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>She was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to the LORD, weeping bitterly.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>She vowed a vow, and said, “LORD of Armies, if you will indeed look at the affliction of your servant and remember me, and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a boy, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and no razor shall come on his head.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>As she continued praying before the LORD, Eli saw her mouth.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Now Hannah spoke in her heart. Only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she was drunk.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Eli said to her, “How long will you be drunk? Get rid of your wine!”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Hannah answered, “No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have not been drinking wine or strong drink, but I poured out my soul before the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Don’t consider your servant a wicked woman; for I have been speaking out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Then Eli answered, “Go in peace; and may the God<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="1sa-1-17-note-1">

As long as he lives he is given to the LORD.” He worshiped the LORD there.</p></section>
