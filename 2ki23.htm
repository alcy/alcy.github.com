    <h1>The Second Book of Kings</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 23</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>The king sent, and they gathered to him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>The king went up to the LORD’s house, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him—with the priests, the prophets, and all the people, both small and great; and he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the LORD’s house.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD to walk after the LORD and to keep his commandments, his testimonies, and his statutes with all his heart and all his soul, to confirm the words of this covenant that were written in this book; and all the people agreed to the covenant.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>The king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the threshold, to bring out of the LORD’s temple all the vessels that were made for Baal, for the Asherah, and for all the army of the sky; and he burned them outside of Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and carried their ashes to Bethel.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>He got rid of the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah and in the places around Jerusalem; those also who burned incense to Baal, to the sun, to the moon, to the planets, and to all the army of the sky.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>He brought out the Asherah from the LORD’s house, outside of Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and beat it to dust, and cast its dust on the graves of the common people.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>He broke down the houses of the male shrine prostitutes that were in the LORD’s house, where the women wove hangings for the Asherah.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>He brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba; and he broke down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man’s left hand at the gate of the city.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Nevertheless the priests of the high places didn’t come up to the LORD’s altar in Jerusalem, but they ate unleavened bread among their brothers.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>He defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>He took away the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun, at the entrance of the LORD’s house, by the room of Nathan Melech the officer who was in the court; and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>The king broke down the altars that were on the roof of the upper room of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the LORD’s house, and beat them down from there, and cast their dust into the brook Kidron.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>The king defiled the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mountain of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>He broke in pieces the pillars, cut down the Asherah poles, and filled their places with men’s bones.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Moreover the altar that was at Bethel and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he broke down; and he burned the high place and beat it to dust, and burned the Asherah.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>As Josiah turned himself, he spied the tombs that were there in the mountain; and he sent, and took the bones out of the tombs, and burned them on the altar, and defiled it, according to the LORD’s word which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these things.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Then he said, “What monument is that which I see?”</p><p>The men of the city told him, “It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and proclaimed these things that you have done against the altar of Bethel.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>He said, “Let him be! Let no one move his bones.” So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet who came out of Samaria.   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>All the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the LORD to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel.   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>He killed all the priests of the high places that were there, on the altars, and burned men’s bones on them; and he returned to Jerusalem.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>The king commanded all the people, saying, “Keep the Passover to the LORD your God, as it is written in this book of the covenant.”   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Surely there was not kept such a Passover from the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>but in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, this Passover was kept to the LORD in Jerusalem.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Moreover, Josiah removed those who had familiar spirits, the wizards, and the teraphim,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="2ki-23-24-note-1">
