    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Moreover Elihu answered,</p><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>“Do you think this to be your right,<br/>or do you say, ‘My righteousness is more than God’s,’<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>that you ask, ‘What advantage will it be to you?<br/>What profit will I have, more than if I had sinned?’<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>I will answer you,<br/>and your companions with you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Look to the skies, and see.<br/>See the skies, which are higher than you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>If you have sinned, what effect do you have against him?<br/>If your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him?<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>If you are righteous, what do you give him?<br/>Or what does he receive from your hand?<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Your wickedness may hurt a man as you are,<br/>and your righteousness may profit a son of man.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>“By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out.<br/>They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>But no one says, ‘Where is God my Maker,<br/>who gives songs in the night,<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>who teaches us more than the animals of the earth,<br/>and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?’<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>There they cry, but no one answers,<br/>because of the pride of evil men.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Surely God will not hear an empty cry,<br/>neither will the Almighty regard it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>How much less when you say you don’t see him.<br/>The cause is before him, and you wait for him!<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>But now, because he has not visited in his anger,<br/>neither does he greatly regard arrogance,<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>therefore Job opens his mouth with empty talk,<br/>and he multiplies words without knowledge.”</p></blockquote></section>
