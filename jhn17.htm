    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Jesus said these things, then lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, <span class="wj">“Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may also glorify you; </span> <span class="verse" id="V2"></span><span class="wj">even as you gave him authority over all flesh, so he will give eternal life to all whom you have given him. </span> <span class="verse" id="V3"></span><span class="wj">This is eternal life, that they should know you, the only true God, and him whom you sent, Jesus Christ. </span> <span class="verse" id="V4"></span><span class="wj">I glorified you on the earth. I have accomplished the work which you have given me to do. </span> <span class="verse" id="V5"></span><span class="wj">Now, Father, glorify me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world existed. </span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span><span class="wj">“I revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out of the world. They were yours, and you have given them to me. They have kept your word. </span> <span class="verse" id="V7"></span><span class="wj">Now they have known that all things whatever you have given me are from you, </span> <span class="verse" id="V8"></span><span class="wj">for the words which you have given me I have given to them; and they received them, and knew for sure that I came from you. They have believed that you sent me. </span> <span class="verse" id="V9"></span><span class="wj">I pray for them. I don’t pray for the world, but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours. </span> <span class="verse" id="V10"></span><span class="wj">All things that are mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them. </span> <span class="verse" id="V11"></span><span class="wj">I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them through your name which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are. </span> <span class="verse" id="V12"></span><span class="wj">While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name. I have kept those whom you have given me. None of them is lost except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled. </span> <span class="verse" id="V13"></span><span class="wj">But now I come to you, and I say these things in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves. </span> <span class="verse" id="V14"></span><span class="wj">I have given them your word. The world hated them because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. </span> <span class="verse" id="V15"></span><span class="wj">I pray not that you would take them from the world, but that you would keep them from the evil one. </span> <span class="verse" id="V16"></span><span class="wj">They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. </span> <span class="verse" id="V17"></span><span class="wj">Sanctify them in your truth.
