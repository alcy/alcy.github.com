Behold, Aaron and Hur are with you. Whoever is involved in a dispute can go to them.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Moses went up on the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>The LORD’s glory settled on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days.
