    <h1>Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Brothers, I couldn’t speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to babies in Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>I fed you with milk, not with solid food, for you weren’t yet ready. Indeed, you aren’t ready even now,   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>for you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, aren’t you fleshly, and don’t you walk in the ways of men?   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” aren’t you fleshly?</p><p><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed, and each as the Lord gave to him?   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>I planted. Apollos watered. But God gave the increase.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Now he who plants and he who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>For we are God’s fellow workers. You are God’s farming, God’s building.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw,   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>each man’s work will be revealed. For the Day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man’s work is.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>If any man’s work remains which he built on it, he will receive a reward.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>If any man’s work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Don’t you know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit lives in you?   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him; for God’s temple is holy, which you are.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool that he may become wise.   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, “He has taken the wise in their craftiness.”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="1co-3-19-note-1">

</span> <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours,   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. All are yours,   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>and you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="1co04.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
