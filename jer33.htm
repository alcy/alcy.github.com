    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>The LORD says: “Yet again there will be heard in this place, about which you say, ‘It is waste, without man and without animal, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and without animal,’   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who say, ‘Give thanks to the LORD of Armies, for the LORD is good, for his loving kindness endures forever;’ who bring thanksgiving into the LORD’s house. For I will cause the captivity of the land to be reversed as at the first,” says the LORD.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>The LORD of Armies says: “Yet again there will be in this place, which is waste, without man and without animal, and in all its cities, a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, in the cities of the South, in the land of Benjamin, in the places around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, the flocks will again pass under the hands of him who counts them,” says the LORD.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>“Behold, the days come,” says the LORD, “that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah.</p><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>“In those days and at that time,<br/>I will cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up to David.<br/>He will execute justice and righteousness in the land.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>In those days Judah will be saved,<br/>and Jerusalem will dwell safely.<br/>This is the name by which she will be called:<br/>The LORD our righteousness.”</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>For the LORD says: “David will never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>The Levitical priests won’t lack a man before me to offer burnt offerings, to burn meal offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>The LORD’s word came to Jeremiah, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>“The LORD says: ‘If you can break my covenant of the day and my covenant of the night, so that there will not be day and night in their time,   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>then my covenant could also be broken with David my servant, that he won’t have a son to reign on his throne; and with the Levitical priests, my ministers.   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>As the army of the sky can’t be counted, and the sand of the sea can’t be measured, so I will multiply the offspring of David my servant and the Levites who minister to me.’ ”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>The LORD’s word came to Jeremiah, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>“Don’t consider what this people has spoken, saying, ‘Has the LORD cast off the two families which he chose?’ Thus they despise my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.”   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>The LORD says: “If my covenant of day and night fails, if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth,   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>then I will also cast away the offspring of Jacob, and of David my servant, so that I will not take of his offspring to be rulers over the offspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; for I will cause their captivity to be reversed and will have mercy on them.”</p></section>
