    <h1>John's Second Letter</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>The elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not I only, but also all those who know the truth,   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>for the truth’s sake, which remains in us, and it will be with us forever:   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="2jn-1-3-note-1">
</label>
<input class="margin-toggle" id="2jn-1-3-note-1" type="checkbox"/>
<span class="sidenote">
        “Christ” means “Anointed One”.
        </span> the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>This is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don’t confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Watch yourselves, that we don’t lose the things which we have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Whoever transgresses and doesn’t remain in the teaching of Christ doesn’t have God. He who remains in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>If anyone comes to you and doesn’t bring this teaching, don’t receive him into your house, and don’t welcome him,   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>for he who welcomes him participates in his evil deeds.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Having many things to write to you, I don’t want to do so with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen.</p></section>
