    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Then Job answered,</p><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>“How long will you torment me,<br/>and crush me with words?<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>You have reproached me ten times.<br/>You aren’t ashamed that you attack me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>If it is true that I have erred,<br/>my error remains with myself.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>If indeed you will magnify yourselves against me,<br/>and plead against me my reproach,<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>know now that God has subverted me,<br/>and has surrounded me with his net.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>“Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard.<br/>I cry for help, but there is no justice.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>He has walled up my way so that I can’t pass,<br/>and has set darkness in my paths.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>He has stripped me of my glory,<br/>and taken the crown from my head.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>He has broken me down on every side, and I am gone.<br/>He has plucked my hope up like a tree.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>He has also kindled his wrath against me.<br/>He counts me among his adversaries.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>His troops come on together,<br/>build a siege ramp against me,<br/>and encamp around my tent.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>“He has put my brothers far from me.<br/>My acquaintances are wholly estranged from me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>My relatives have gone away.<br/>My familiar friends have forgotten me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Those who dwell in my house and my maids consider me a stranger.<br/>I am an alien in their sight.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>I call to my servant, and he gives me no answer.<br/>I beg him with my mouth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>My breath is offensive to my wife.<br/>I am loathsome to the children of my own mother.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Even young children despise me.<br/>If I arise, they speak against me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>All my familiar friends abhor me.<br/>They whom I loved have turned against me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>My bones stick to my skin and to my flesh.<br/>I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>“Have pity on me. Have pity on me, you my friends,<br/>for the hand of God has touched me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Why do you persecute me as God,<br/>and are not satisfied with my flesh?<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>“Oh that my words were now written!<br/>Oh that they were inscribed in a book!<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>That with an iron pen and lead<br/>they were engraved in the rock forever!<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>But as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives.<br/>In the end, he will stand upon the earth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>After my skin is destroyed,<br/>then I will see God in my flesh,<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>whom I, even I, will see on my side.<br/>My eyes will see, and not as a stranger.<br/>“My heart is consumed within me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>If you say, ‘How we will persecute him!’<br/>because the root of the matter is found in me,<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>be afraid of the sword,<br/>for wrath brings the punishments of the sword,<br/>that you may know there is a judgment.” <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="job20.htm">→</a></span></p></blockquote></section>
