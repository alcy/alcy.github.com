If anything remains until the third day, it shall be burned with fire.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>If it is eaten at all on the third day, it is an abomination. It will not be accepted;   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>but everyone who eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the holy thing of the LORD, and that soul shall be cut off from his people.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>“ ‘When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap the corners of your field, neither shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>You shall not glean your vineyard, neither shall you gather the fallen grapes of your vineyard.
