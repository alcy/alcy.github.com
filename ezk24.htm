    <h2>Chapter 24</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the LORD’s word came to me, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>“Son of man, write the name of the day, this same day. The king of Babylon drew close to Jerusalem this same day.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Utter a parable to the rebellious house, and tell them, ‘The Lord GOD says,</p><blockquote><p>“Put the cauldron on the fire.<br/>Put it on,<br/>and also pour water into it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Gather its pieces into it,<br/>even every good piece:<br/>the thigh and the shoulder.<br/>Fill it with the choice bones.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Take the choice of the flock,<br/>and also a pile of wood for the bones under the cauldron.<br/>Make it boil well.<br/>Yes, let its bones be boiled within it.”</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>“ ‘Therefore the Lord GOD says:</p><blockquote><p>“Woe to the bloody city,<br/>to the cauldron whose rust is in it,<br/>and whose rust hasn’t gone out of it!<br/>Take out of it piece after piece<br/>without casting lots for it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>“ ‘ “For the blood she shed is in the middle of her.<br/>She set it on the bare rock.<br/>She didn’t pour it on the ground,<br/>to cover it with dust.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance,<br/>I have set her blood on the bare rock,<br/>that it should not be covered.”</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>“ ‘Therefore the Lord GOD says:</p><blockquote><p>“Woe to the bloody city!<br/>I also will make the pile great.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Heap on the wood.<br/>Make the fire hot.<br/>Boil the meat well.<br/>Make the broth thick,<br/>and let the bones be burned.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Then set it empty on its coals,<br/>that it may be hot,<br/>and its bronze may burn,<br/>and that its filthiness may be molten in it,<br/>that its rust may be consumed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>She is weary with toil;<br/>yet her great rust,<br/>rust by fire, doesn’t leave her.</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>“ ‘ “In your filthiness is lewdness. Because I have cleansed you and you weren’t cleansed, you won’t be cleansed from your filthiness any more, until I have caused my wrath toward you to rest.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>“ ‘ “I, the LORD, have spoken it. It will happen, and I will do it. I won’t go back. I won’t spare. I won’t repent. According to your ways and according to your doings, they will judge you,” says the Lord GOD.’ ”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Also the LORD’s word came to me, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>“Son of man, behold, I will take away from you the desire of your eyes with one stroke; yet you shall neither mourn nor weep, neither shall your tears run down.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Sigh, but not aloud. Make no mourning for the dead. Bind your headdress on you, and put your sandals on your feet. Don’t cover your lips, and don’t eat mourner’s bread.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>So I spoke to the people in the morning, and at evening my wife died. So I did in the morning as I was commanded.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>The people asked me, “Won’t you tell us what these things mean to us, that you act like this?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Then I said to them, “The LORD’s word came to me, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>‘Speak to the house of Israel, “The Lord GOD says: ‘Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pities; and your sons and your daughters whom you have left behind will fall by the sword.   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>You will do as I have done. You won’t cover your lips or eat mourner’s bread.   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Your turbans will be on your heads, and your sandals on your feet. You won’t mourn or weep; but you will pine away in your iniquities, and moan one toward another.   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Thus Ezekiel will be a sign to you; according to all that he has done, you will do. When this comes, then you will know that I am the Lord GOD.’ ” ’ ”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>“You, son of man, shouldn’t it be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their heart—their sons and their daughters—   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>that in that day he who escapes will come to you, to cause you to hear it with your ears?   <span class="verse" id="V27"></span>In that day your mouth will be opened to him who has escaped, and you will speak and be no more mute. So you will be a sign to them. Then they will know that I am the LORD.”</p></section>
