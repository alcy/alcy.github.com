Not only idle, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought not.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>I desire therefore that the younger widows marry, bear children, rule the household, and give no occasion to the adversary for insulting.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>For already some have turned away after Satan.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>If any man or woman who believes has widows, let them relieve them, and don’t let the assembly be burdened, that it might relieve those who are widows indeed.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>For the Scripture says, “You shall not muzzle the ox when it treads out the grain.”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="1ti-5-18-note-1">
