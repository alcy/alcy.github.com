        “Christ” means “Anointed One”.
        </span> and God the Father, who raised him from the dead—   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>and all the brothers<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="gal-1-2-note-1">

        The word for “brothers” here and where context allows may also be correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.”
        </span> who are with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father—   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different “good news”,   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>but there isn’t another “good news.” Only there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the Good News of Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any “good news” other than that which we preached to you, let him be cursed.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>As we have said before, so I now say again: if any man preaches to you any “good news” other than that which you received, let him be cursed.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? For if I were still pleasing men, I wouldn’t be a servant of Christ.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the Good News which was preached by me, that it is not according to man.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>For I didn’t receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God and ravaged it.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from my mother’s womb and called me through his grace,   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn’t immediately confer with flesh and blood,   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia. Then I returned to Damascus.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>But of the other apostles I saw no one except James, the Lord’s brother.   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Now about the things which I write to you, behold,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="gal-1-20-note-1">

        “Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.
        </span> before God, I’m not lying.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in Christ,   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>but they only heard, “He who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy.”   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>So they glorified God in me. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="gal02.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
