I am not lying, my conscience testifying with me in the Holy Spirit   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers’ sake, my relatives according to the flesh   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service, and the promises;   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>of whom are the fathers, and from whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God, blessed forever. Amen.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>But it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing. For they are not all Israel that are of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Neither, because they are Abraham’s offspring, are they all children. But, “your offspring will be accounted as from Isaac.”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="rom-9-7-note-1">
