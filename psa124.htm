    <h1>Psalm 124</h1>

    <p class="psalm-subtitle">A Song of Ascents. By David.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>If it had not been the LORD who was on our side,<br/>let Israel now say,<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>if it had not been the LORD who was on our side,<br/>when men rose up against us,<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>then they would have swallowed us up alive,<br/>when their wrath was kindled against us,<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>then the waters would have overwhelmed us,<br/>the stream would have gone over our soul.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Then the proud waters would have gone over our soul.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Blessed be the LORD,<br/>who has not given us as a prey to their teeth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowler’s snare.<br/>The snare is broken, and we have escaped.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Our help is in the LORD’s name,<br/>who made heaven and earth.</p></blockquote></section>
