    <h1>The First Book of Samuel</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>When Samuel was old, he made his sons judges over Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Now the name of his firstborn was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah. They were judges in Beersheba.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>His sons didn’t walk in his ways, but turned away after dishonest gain, took bribes, and perverted justice.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together and came to Samuel to Ramah.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>They said to him, “Behold, you are old, and your sons don’t walk in your ways. Now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.”   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, “Give us a king to judge us.”</p><p>Samuel prayed to the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>The LORD said to Samuel, “Listen to the voice of the people in all that they tell you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me as the king over them.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day, in that they have forsaken me and served other gods, so they also do to you.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Now therefore, listen to their voice. However, you shall protest solemnly to them, and shall show them the way of the king who will reign over them.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Samuel told all the LORD’s words to the people who asked him for a king.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>He said, “This will be the way of the king who shall reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them as his servants, for his chariots and to be his horsemen; and they will run before his chariots.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>He will appoint them to him for captains of thousands and captains of fifties; and he will assign some to plow his ground and to reap his harvest; and to make his instruments of war and the instruments of his chariots.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>He will take your daughters to be perfumers, to be cooks, and to be bakers.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>He will take your fields, your vineyards, and your olive groves, even your best, and give them to his servants.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>He will take one tenth of your seed and of your vineyards, and give it to his officers and to his servants.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>He will take your male servants, your female servants, your best young men, and your donkeys, and assign them to his own work.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>He will take one tenth of your flocks; and you will be his servants.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>You will cry out in that day because of your king whom you will have chosen for yourselves; and the LORD will not answer you in that day.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel; and they said, “No, but we will have a king over us,   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>that we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>The LORD said to Samuel, “Listen to their voice, and make them a king.”</p><p>Samuel said to the men of Israel, “Everyone go to your own city.”</p></section>
