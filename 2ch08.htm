So the LORD’s house was completed.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Then Solomon went to Ezion Geber and to Eloth, on the seashore in the land of Edom.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Huram sent him ships and servants who had knowledge of the sea by the hands of his servants; and they came with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and brought from there four hundred fifty talents<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="2ch-8-18-note-1">
