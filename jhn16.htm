I didn’t tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with you. </span> <span class="verse" id="V5"></span><span class="wj">But now I am going to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’ </span> <span class="verse" id="V6"></span><span class="wj">But because I have told you these things, sorrow has filled your heart. </span> <span class="verse" id="V7"></span><span class="wj">Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is to your advantage that I go away; for if I don’t go away, the Counselor won’t come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you. </span> <span class="verse" id="V8"></span><span class="wj">When he has come, he will convict the world about sin, about righteousness, and about judgment; </span> <span class="verse" id="V9"></span><span class="wj">about sin, because they don’t believe in me; </span> <span class="verse" id="V10"></span><span class="wj">about righteousness, because I am going to my Father, and you won’t see me any more; </span> <span class="verse" id="V11"></span><span class="wj">about judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged. </span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span><span class="wj">“I still have many things to tell you, but you can’t bear them now. </span> <span class="verse" id="V13"></span><span class="wj">However, when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will guide you into all truth, for he will not speak from himself; but whatever he hears, he will speak.

Again a little while, and you will see me.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Some of his disciples therefore said to one another, “What is this that he says to us, <span class="wj">‘A little while, and you won’t see me, and again a little while, and you will see me;’</span> and, <span class="wj">‘Because I go to the Father’</span>?”   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>They said therefore, “What is this that he says, <span class="wj">‘A little while’</span>? We don’t know what he is saying.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Therefore Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him, and he said to them, <span class="wj">“Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, ‘A little while, and you won’t see me, and again a little while, and you will see me’? </span> <span class="verse" id="V20"></span><span class="wj">Most certainly I tell you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy. </span> <span class="verse" id="V21"></span><span class="wj">A woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow because her time has come. But when she has delivered the child, she doesn’t remember the anguish any more, for the joy that a human being is born into the world. </span> <span class="verse" id="V22"></span><span class="wj">Therefore you now have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V23"></span><span class="wj">“In that day you will ask me no questions. Most certainly I tell you, whatever you may ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you. </span> <span class="verse" id="V24"></span><span class="wj">Until now, you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be made full. </span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V25"></span><span class="wj">“I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech. But the time is coming when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly about the Father. </span> <span class="verse" id="V26"></span><span class="wj">In that day you will ask in my name; and I don’t say to you that I will pray to the Father for you, </span> <span class="verse" id="V27"></span><span class="wj">for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came from God. </span> <span class="verse" id="V28"></span><span class="wj">I came from the Father and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world and go to the Father.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>His disciples said to him, “Behold, now you are speaking plainly, and using no figures of speech.   <span class="verse" id="V30"></span>Now we know that you know all things, and don’t need for anyone to question you. By this we believe that you came from God.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>Jesus answered them, <span class="wj">“Do you now believe? </span> <span class="verse" id="V32"></span><span class="wj">Behold, the time is coming, yes, and has now come, that you will be scattered, everyone to his own place, and you will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. </span> <span class="verse" id="V33"></span><span class="wj">I have told you these things, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have trouble; but cheer up! I have overcome the world.” </span></p></section>
