    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Jesus went out from the temple, and was going on his way. His disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>But he answered them, <span class="wj">“You see all of these things, don’t you? Most certainly I tell you, there will not be left here one stone on another, that will not be thrown down.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, “Tell us, when will these things be? What is the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Jesus answered them, <span class="wj">“Be careful that no one leads you astray. </span> <span class="verse" id="V5"></span><span class="wj">For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and will lead many astray. </span> <span class="verse" id="V6"></span><span class="wj">You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you aren’t troubled, for all this must happen, but the end is not yet. </span> <span class="verse" id="V7"></span><span class="wj">For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines, plagues, and earthquakes in various places. </span> <span class="verse" id="V8"></span><span class="wj">But all these things are the beginning of birth pains. </span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span><span class="wj">“Then they will deliver you up to oppression and will kill you. You will be hated by all of the nations for my name’s sake. </span> <span class="verse" id="V10"></span><span class="wj">Then many will stumble, and will deliver up one another, and will hate one another. </span> <span class="verse" id="V11"></span><span class="wj">Many false prophets will arise and will lead many astray. </span> <span class="verse" id="V12"></span><span class="wj">Because iniquity will be multiplied, the love of many will grow cold. </span> <span class="verse" id="V13"></span><span class="wj">But he who endures to the end will be saved. </span> <span class="verse" id="V14"></span><span class="wj">This Good News of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V15"></span><span class="wj">“When, therefore, you see the abomination of desolation,</span><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="mat-24-15-note-1">
