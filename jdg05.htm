    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying,</p><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>“Because the leaders took the lead in Israel,<br/>because the people offered themselves willingly,<br/>be blessed, LORD!<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>“Hear, you kings!<br/>Give ear, you princes!<br/>I, even I, will sing to the LORD.<br/>I will sing praise to the LORD, the God of Israel.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>“LORD, when you went out of Seir,<br/>when you marched out of the field of Edom,<br/>the earth trembled, the sky also dropped.<br/>Yes, the clouds dropped water.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>The mountains quaked at the LORD’s presence,<br/>even Sinai at the presence of the LORD, the God of Israel.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>“In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath,<br/>in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied.<br/>The travelers walked through byways.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>The rulers ceased in Israel.<br/>They ceased until I, Deborah, arose;<br/>Until I arose a mother in Israel.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>They chose new gods.<br/>Then war was in the gates.<br/>Was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>My heart is toward the governors of Israel,<br/>who offered themselves willingly among the people.<br/>Bless the LORD!<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>“Speak, you who ride on white donkeys,<br/>you who sit on rich carpets,<br/>and you who walk by the way.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Far from the noise of archers, in the places of drawing water,<br/>there they will rehearse the LORD’s righteous acts,<br/>the righteous acts of his rule in Israel.<br/>“Then the LORD’s people went down to the gates.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>‘Awake, awake, Deborah!<br/>Awake, awake, utter a song!<br/>Arise, Barak, and lead away your captives, you son of Abinoam.’<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>“Then a remnant of the nobles and the people came down.<br/>The LORD came down for me against the mighty.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Those whose root is in Amalek came out of Ephraim,<br/>after you, Benjamin, among your peoples.<br/>Governors come down out of Machir.<br/>Those who handle the marshal’s staff came out of Zebulun.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>The princes of Issachar were with Deborah.<br/>As was Issachar, so was Barak.<br/>They rushed into the valley at his feet.<br/>By the watercourses of Reuben,<br/>there were great resolves of heart.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Why did you sit among the sheepfolds?<br/>To hear the whistling for the flocks?<br/>At the watercourses of Reuben,<br/>there were great searchings of heart.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Gilead lived beyond the Jordan.<br/>Why did Dan remain in ships?<br/>Asher sat still at the haven of the sea,<br/>and lived by his creeks.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Zebulun was a people that jeopardized their lives to the death;<br/>Naphtali also, on the high places of the field.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>“The kings came and fought,<br/>then the kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo.<br/>They took no plunder of silver.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>From the sky the stars fought.<br/>From their courses, they fought against Sisera.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>The river Kishon swept them away,<br/>that ancient river, the river Kishon.<br/>My soul, march on with strength.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Then the horse hoofs stamped because of the prancing,<br/>the prancing of their strong ones.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>‘Curse Meroz,’ said the LORD’s angel.<br/>‘Curse bitterly its inhabitants,<br/>because they didn’t come to help the LORD,<br/>to help the LORD against the mighty.’<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>“Jael shall be blessed above women,<br/>the wife of Heber the Kenite;<br/>blessed shall she be above women in the tent.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>He asked for water.<br/>She gave him milk.<br/>She brought him butter in a lordly dish.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>She put her hand to the tent peg,<br/>and her right hand to the workmen’s hammer.<br/>With the hammer she struck Sisera.<br/>She struck through his head.<br/>Yes, she pierced and struck through his temples.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay.<br/>At her feet he bowed, he fell.<br/>Where he bowed, there he fell down dead.<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>“Through the window she looked out, and cried:<br/>Sisera’s mother looked through the lattice.<br/>‘Why is his chariot so long in coming?<br/>Why do the wheels of his chariots wait?’<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>Her wise ladies answered her,<br/>Yes, she returned answer to herself,<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>‘Have they not found, have they not divided the plunder?<br/>A lady, two ladies to every man;<br/>to Sisera a plunder of dyed garments,<br/>a plunder of dyed garments embroidered,<br/>of dyed garments embroidered on both sides, on the necks of the plunder?’<br/><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>“So let all your enemies perish, LORD,<br/>but let those who love him be as the sun when it rises in its strength.”</p></blockquote><p>Then the land had rest forty years.</p></section>
