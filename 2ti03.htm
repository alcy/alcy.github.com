    <h1>Paul's Second Letter to Timothy</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>But know this: that in the last days, grievous times will come.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, not lovers of good,   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>holding a form of godliness but having denied its power. Turn away from these, also.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>For some of these are people who creep into houses and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind, who concerning the faith are rejected.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>But you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness,   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>persecutions, and sufferings—those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions. The Lord delivered me out of them all.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>From infancy, you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Every Scripture is God-breathed and<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="2ti-3-16-note-1">

        or, Every writing inspired by God is
        </span> profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness,   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>that each person who belongs to God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="2ti04.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
