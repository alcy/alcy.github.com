    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>By night on my bed,</p><blockquote><p>I sought him whom my soul loves.<br/>I sought him, but I didn’t find him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>I will get up now, and go about the city;<br/>in the streets and in the squares I will seek him whom my soul loves.<br/>I sought him, but I didn’t find him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>The watchmen who go about the city found me;<br/>“Have you seen him whom my soul loves?”<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>I had scarcely passed from them,<br/>when I found him whom my soul loves.<br/>I held him, and would not let him go,<br/>until I had brought him into my mother’s house,<br/>into the room of her who conceived me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,<br/>by the roes, or by the hinds of the field,<br/>that you not stir up nor awaken love,<br/>until it so desires.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Who is this who comes up from the wilderness like pillars of smoke,<br/>perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,<br/>with all spices of the merchant?<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Behold, it is Solomon’s carriage!<br/>Sixty mighty men are around it,<br/>of the mighty men of Israel.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>They all handle the sword, and are expert in war.<br/>Every man has his sword on his thigh,<br/>because of fear in the night.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>King Solomon made himself a carriage<br/>of the wood of Lebanon.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>He made its pillars of silver,<br/>its bottom of gold, its seat of purple,<br/>the middle of it being paved with love,<br/>from the daughters of Jerusalem.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Go out, you daughters of Zion, and see King Solomon,<br/>with the crown with which his mother has crowned him,<br/>in the day of his weddings,<br/>in the day of the gladness of his heart.</p></blockquote></section>
