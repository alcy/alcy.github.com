    <h1>Paul's Letter to the Galatians</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and don’t be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Yes, I testify again to every man who receives circumcision that he is a debtor to do the whole law.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>You are alienated from Christ, you who desire to be justified by the law. You have fallen away from grace.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>For we through the Spirit, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision amounts to anything, but faith working through love.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>You were running well! Who interfered with you that you should not obey the truth?   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>This persuasion is not from him who calls you.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>A little yeast grows through the whole lump.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way. But he who troubles you will bear his judgment, whoever he is.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>I wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>For you, brothers, were called for freedom. Only don’t use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love be servants to one another.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="gal-5-14-note-1">

<a href="lev19.htm#v18">Leviticus 19:18</a>
</span> <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>But if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you don’t consume one another.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you won’t fulfill the lust of the flesh.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, that you may not do the things that you desire.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Now the deeds of the flesh are obvious, which are: adultery, sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness,   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions, heresies,   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>envy, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which I forewarn you, even as I also forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit God’s Kingdom.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="gal-5-22-note-1">

Against such things there is no law.   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>If we live by the Spirit, let’s also walk by the Spirit.   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>Let’s not become conceited, provoking one another, and envying one another. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="gal06.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
