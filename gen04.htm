        or, became pregnant
        </span> and gave birth to Cain, and said, “I have gotten a man with the LORD’s help.”   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Again she gave birth, to Cain’s brother Abel. Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>As time passed, Cain brought an offering to the LORD from the fruit of the ground.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Abel also brought some of the firstborn of his flock and of its fat. The LORD respected Abel and his offering,   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>but he didn’t respect Cain and his offering. Cain was very angry, and the expression on his face fell.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>The LORD said to Cain, “Why are you angry? Why has the expression of your face fallen?   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>If you do well, won’t it be lifted up? If you don’t do well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire is for you, but you are to rule over it.”   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Cain said to Abel, his brother, “Let’s go into the field.” While they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>The LORD said to Cain, “Where is Abel, your brother?”</p><p>He said, “I don’t know. Am I my brother’s keeper?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>The LORD said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cries to me from the ground.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>From now on, when you till the ground, it won’t yield its strength to you. You will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Cain said to the LORD, “My punishment is greater than I can bear.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Behold, you have driven me out today from the surface of the ground. I will be hidden from your face, and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. Whoever finds me will kill me.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>The LORD said to him, “Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold.” The LORD appointed a sign for Cain, so that anyone finding him would not strike him.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Cain left the LORD’s presence, and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Cain knew his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Enoch. He built a city, and named the city after the name of his son, Enoch.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Irad was born to Enoch. Irad became the father of Mehujael. Mehujael became the father of Methushael. Methushael became the father of Lamech.   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Lamech took two wives: the name of the first one was Adah, and the name of the second one was Zillah.   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>His brother’s name was Jubal, who was the father of all who handle the harp and pipe.   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Zillah also gave birth to Tubal Cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of bronze and iron. Tubal Cain’s sister was Naamah.   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Lamech said to his wives,</p><blockquote><p>“Adah and Zillah, hear my voice.<br/>You wives of Lamech, listen to my speech,<br/>for I have slain a man for wounding me,<br/>a young man for bruising me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>If Cain will be avenged seven times,<br/>truly Lamech seventy-seven times.”</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>Adam knew his wife again. She gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, saying, “for God has given me another child instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.”   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>A son was also born to Seth, and he named him Enosh. At that time men began to call on the LORD’s name. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="gen05.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
