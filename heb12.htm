    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Therefore let’s also, seeing we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let’s run with perseverance the race that is set before us,   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>looking to Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising its shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For consider him who has endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, that you don’t grow weary, fainting in your souls.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>You have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>You have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with children,</p><blockquote><p>“My son, don’t take lightly the chastening of the Lord,<br/>nor faint when you are reproved by him;<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>for whom the Lord loves, he disciplines,<br/>and chastises every son whom he receives.”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="heb-12-6-note-1">

</span></p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>It is for discipline that you endure. God deals with you as with children, for what son is there whom his father doesn’t discipline?   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>But if you are without discipline, of which all have been made partakers, then you are illegitimate, and not children.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we paid them respect. Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live?   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>For they indeed for a few days disciplined us as seemed good to them, but he for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>All chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Therefore lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees, <label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="heb-12-12-note-1">
