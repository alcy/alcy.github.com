    <h2>Chapter 27</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>the LORD says to me: “Make bonds and bars, and put them on your neck.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Then send them to the king of Edom, to the king of Moab, to the king of the children of Ammon, to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon, by the hand of the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Give them a command to their masters, saying, ‘The LORD of Armies, the God of Israel says, “You shall tell your masters:   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>‘I have made the earth, the men, and the animals that are on the surface of the earth by my great power and by my outstretched arm. I give it to whom it seems right to me.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant. I have also given the animals of the field to him to serve him.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>All the nations will serve him, his son, and his son’s son, until the time of his own land comes. Then many nations and great kings will make him their bondservant.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>“ ‘ “ ‘It will happen that I will punish the nation and the kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon,’ says the LORD, ‘with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>But as for you, don’t listen to your prophets, to your diviners, to your dreams, to your soothsayers, or to your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, “You shall not serve the king of Babylon;”   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>for they prophesy a lie to you, to remove you far from your land, so that I would drive you out, and you would perish.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>But the nation that brings their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serves him, that nation I will let remain in their own land,’ says the LORD; ‘and they will till it and dwell in it.’ ” ’ ”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, “Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Why will you die, you and your people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD has spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Don’t listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you, saying, ‘You shall not serve the king of Babylon;’ for they prophesy a lie to you.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>For I have not sent them,” says the LORD, “but they prophesy falsely in my name; that I may drive you out, and that you may perish, you, and the prophets who prophesy to you.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, the LORD says, “Don’t listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, ‘Behold, the vessels of the LORD’s house will now shortly be brought again from Babylon;’ for they prophesy a lie to you.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Don’t listen to them. Serve the king of Babylon, and live. Why should this city become a desolation?   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>But if they are prophets, and if the LORD’s word is with them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of Armies, that the vessels which are left in the LORD’s house, in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, don’t go to Babylon.   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>For the LORD of Armies says concerning the pillars, concerning the sea, concerning the bases, and concerning the rest of the vessels that are left in this city,   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon didn’t take when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem—   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>yes, the LORD of Armies, the God of Israel, says concerning the vessels that are left in the LORD’s house, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem:   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>‘They will be carried to Babylon, and there they will be, until the day that I visit them,’ says the LORD; ‘then I will bring them up, and restore them to this place.’ ”</p></section>
