    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Moreover the LORD answered Job,</p><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>“Shall he who argues contend with the Almighty?<br/>He who argues with God, let him answer it.”</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Then Job answered the LORD,</p><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>“Behold, I am of small account. What will I answer you?<br/>I lay my hand on my mouth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>I have spoken once, and I will not answer;<br/>Yes, twice, but I will proceed no further.”</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind:</p><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>“Now brace yourself like a man.<br/>I will question you, and you will answer me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Will you even annul my judgment?<br/>Will you condemn me, that you may be justified?<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Or do you have an arm like God?<br/>Can you thunder with a voice like him?<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>“Now deck yourself with excellency and dignity.<br/>Array yourself with honor and majesty.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Pour out the fury of your anger.<br/>Look at everyone who is proud, and bring him low.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Look at everyone who is proud, and humble him.<br/>Crush the wicked in their place.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Hide them in the dust together.<br/>Bind their faces in the hidden place.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Then I will also admit to you<br/>that your own right hand can save you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>“See now behemoth, which I made as well as you.<br/>He eats grass as an ox.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Look now, his strength is in his thighs.<br/>His force is in the muscles of his belly.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>He moves his tail like a cedar.<br/>The sinews of his thighs are knit together.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>His bones are like tubes of bronze.<br/>His limbs are like bars of iron.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>He is the chief of the ways of God.<br/>He who made him gives him his sword.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Surely the mountains produce food for him,<br/>where all the animals of the field play.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>He lies under the lotus trees,<br/>in the covert of the reed, and the marsh.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>The lotuses cover him with their shade.<br/>The willows of the brook surround him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Behold, if a river overflows, he doesn’t tremble.<br/>He is confident, though the Jordan swells even to his mouth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Shall any take him when he is on the watch,<br/>or pierce through his nose with a snare?</p></blockquote></section>
