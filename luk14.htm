For you will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous.” </span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>When one of those who sat at the table with him heard these things, he said to him, “Blessed is he who will feast in God’s Kingdom!”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>But he said to him, <span class="wj">“A certain man made a great supper, and he invited many people. </span> <span class="verse" id="V17"></span><span class="wj">He sent out his servant at supper time to tell those who were invited, ‘Come, for everything is ready now.’ </span> <span class="verse" id="V18"></span><span class="wj">They all as one began to make excuses.</span></p><p><span class="wj">“The first said to him, ‘I have bought a field, and I must go and see it.

Please have me excused.’</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V20"></span><span class="wj">“Another said, ‘I have married a wife, and therefore I can’t come.’ </span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V21"></span><span class="wj">“That servant came, and told his lord these things.
