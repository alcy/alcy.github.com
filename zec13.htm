I will also cause the prophets and the spirit of impurity to pass out of the land.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>It will happen that when anyone still prophesies, then his father and his mother who bore him will tell him, ‘You must die, because you speak lies in the LORD’s name;’ and his father and his mother who bore him will stab him when he prophesies.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>It will happen in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies; they won’t wear a hairy mantle to deceive,   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>but he will say, ‘I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the ground; for I have been made a bondservant from my youth.’   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>One will say to him, ‘What are these wounds between your arms?’ Then he will answer, ‘Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.’</p><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>“Awake, sword, against my shepherd,<br/>and against the man who is close to me,” says the LORD of Armies.<br/>“Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered;<br/>and I will turn my hand against the little ones.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>It shall happen that in all the land,” says the LORD,<br/>“two parts in it will be cut off and die;<br/>but the third will be left in it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>I will bring the third part into the fire,<br/>and will refine them as silver is refined,<br/>and will test them like gold is tested.<br/>They will call on my name, and I will hear them.<br/>I will say, ‘It is my people;’<br/>and they will say, ‘The LORD is my God.’ ” <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="zec14.htm">→</a></span></p></blockquote></section>
