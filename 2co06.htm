    <h1>Paul's Second Letter to the Corinthians</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Working together, we entreat also that you do not receive the grace of God in vain.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>For he says,</p><blockquote><p>“At an acceptable time I listened to you.<br/>In a day of salvation I helped you.”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="2co-6-2-note-1">

</span></p></blockquote><p>Behold, now is the acceptable time. Behold, now is the day of salvation.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>We give no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our service may not be blamed,   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>but in everything commending ourselves as servants of God: in great endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses,   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in watchings, in fastings,   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>in pureness, in knowledge, in perseverance, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in sincere love,   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>in the word of truth, in the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report, as deceivers and yet true,   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>as unknown and yet well known, as dying and behold—we live, as punished and not killed,   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>as sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor yet making many rich, as having nothing and yet possessing all things.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Our mouth is open to you, Corinthians. Our heart is enlarged.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your own affections.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Now in return—I speak as to my children—you also open your hearts.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Don’t be unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what fellowship do righteousness and iniquity have? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness?   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>What agreement does Christ have with Belial? Or what portion does a believer have with an unbeliever?   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>What agreement does a temple of God have with idols? For you are a temple of the living God. Even as God said, “I will dwell in them and walk in them. I will be their God and they will be my people.”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="2co-6-16-note-1">
