His voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth was illuminated with his glory.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>It was like the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>The LORD’s glory came into the house by the way of the gate which faces toward the east.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>The Spirit took me up and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the LORD’s glory filled the house.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>I heard one speaking to me out of the house, and a man stood by me.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>He said to me, “Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell among the children of Israel forever. The house of Israel will no more defile my holy name, neither they nor their kings, by their prostitution and by the dead bodies of their kings in their high places;   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>in their setting of their threshold by my threshold and their door post beside my door post. There was a wall between me and them; and they have defiled my holy name by their abominations which they have committed. Therefore I have consumed them in my anger.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Now let them put away their prostitution, and the dead bodies of their kings far from me. Then I will dwell among them forever.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>“You, son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>If they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the form of the house, its fashion, its exits, its entrances, its structure, all its ordinances, all its forms, and all its laws; and write it in their sight, that they may keep the whole form of it, and all its ordinances, and do them.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>“This is the law of the house. On the top of the mountain the whole limit around it shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>“These are the measurements of the altar by cubits (the cubit<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="ezk-43-13-note-1">

        A span is the length from the tip of a man’s thumb to the tip of his little finger when his hand is stretched out (about half a cubit, or 9 inches, or 22.8 cm.)

You shall cleanse it and make atonement for it that way.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>You shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and it shall be burned in the appointed place of the house, outside of the sanctuary.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>“On the second day you shall offer a male goat without defect for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they cleansed it with the bull.   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>When you have finished cleansing it, you shall offer a young bull without defect and a ram out of the flock without defect.   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>You shall bring them near to the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt on them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering to the LORD.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>“Seven days you shall prepare every day a goat for a sin offering. They shall also prepare a young bull and a ram out of the flock, without defect.   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it. So shall they consecrate it.   <span class="verse" id="V27"></span>When they have accomplished the days, it shall be that on the eighth day and onward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings on the altar and your peace offerings. Then I will accept you,’ says the Lord GOD.”</p></section>
