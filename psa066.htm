    <p class="psalm-subtitle">For the Chief Musician. A song. A Psalm.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Make a joyful shout to God, all the earth!<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Sing to the glory of his name!<br/>Offer glory and praise!<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Tell God, “How awesome are your deeds!<br/>Through the greatness of your power, your enemies submit themselves to you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>All the earth will worship you,<br/>and will sing to you;<br/>they will sing to your name.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Come, and see God’s deeds—<br/>awesome work on behalf of the children of men.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>He turned the sea into dry land.<br/>They went through the river on foot.<br/>There, we rejoiced in him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>He rules by his might forever.<br/>His eyes watch the nations.<br/>Don’t let the rebellious rise up against him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Praise our God, you peoples!<br/>Make the sound of his praise heard,<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>who preserves our life among the living,<br/>and doesn’t allow our feet to be moved.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>For you, God, have tested us.<br/>You have refined us, as silver is refined.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>You brought us into prison.<br/>You laid a burden on our backs.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>You allowed men to ride over our heads.<br/>We went through fire and through water,<br/>but you brought us to the place of abundance.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>I will come into your temple with burnt offerings.<br/>I will pay my vows to you,   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>which my lips promised,<br/>and my mouth spoke, when I was in distress.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>I will offer to you burnt offerings of fat animals,<br/>with the offering of rams,<br/>I will offer bulls with goats.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Come and hear, all you who fear God.<br/>I will declare what he has done for my soul.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>I cried to him with my mouth.<br/>He was extolled with my tongue.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>If I cherished sin in my heart,<br/>the Lord wouldn’t have listened.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>But most certainly, God has listened.<br/>He has heard the voice of my prayer.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer,<br/>nor his loving kindness from me.</p></blockquote></section>
