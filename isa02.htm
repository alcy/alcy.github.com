    <h1>Isaiah</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>This is what Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</p><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>It shall happen in the latter days, that the mountain of the LORD’s house shall be established on the top of the mountains,<br/>and shall be raised above the hills;<br/>and all nations shall flow to it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Many peoples shall go and say,<br/>“Come, let’s go up to the mountain of the LORD,<br/>to the house of the God of Jacob;<br/>and he will teach us of his ways,<br/>and we will walk in his paths.”<br/>For the law shall go out of Zion,<br/>and the LORD’s word from Jerusalem.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>He will judge between the nations,<br/>and will decide concerning many peoples.<br/>They shall beat their swords into plowshares,<br/>and their spears into pruning hooks.<br/>Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,<br/>neither shall they learn war any more.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>House of Jacob, come, and let’s walk in the light of the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>For you have forsaken your people, the house of Jacob,<br/>because they are filled from the east,<br/>with those who practice divination like the Philistines,<br/>and they clasp hands with the children of foreigners.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Their land is full of silver and gold,<br/>neither is there any end of their treasures.<br/>Their land also is full of horses,<br/>neither is there any end of their chariots.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Their land also is full of idols.<br/>They worship the work of their own hands,<br/>that which their own fingers have made.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Man is brought low,<br/>and mankind is humbled;<br/>therefore don’t forgive them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Enter into the rock,<br/>and hide in the dust,<br/>from before the terror of the LORD,<br/>and from the glory of his majesty.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>The lofty looks of man will be brought low,<br/>the arrogance of men will be bowed down,<br/>and the LORD alone will be exalted in that day.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>For there will be a day of the LORD of Armies for all that is proud and arrogant,<br/>and for all that is lifted up,<br/>and it shall be brought low—<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>for all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up,<br/>for all the oaks of Bashan,<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>for all the high mountains,<br/>for all the hills that are lifted up,<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>for every lofty tower,<br/>for every fortified wall,<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>for all the ships of Tarshish,<br/>and for all pleasant imagery.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>The loftiness of man shall be bowed down,<br/>and the arrogance of men shall be brought low;<br/>and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>The idols shall utterly pass away.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Men shall go into the caves of the rocks,<br/>and into the holes of the earth,<br/>from before the terror of the LORD,<br/>and from the glory of his majesty,<br/>when he arises to shake the earth mightily.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>In that day, men shall cast away their idols of silver<br/>and their idols of gold,<br/>which have been made for themselves to worship,<br/>to the moles and to the bats,<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>to go into the caverns of the rocks,<br/>and into the clefts of the ragged rocks,<br/>from before the terror of the LORD,<br/>and from the glory of his majesty,<br/>when he arises to shake the earth mightily.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Stop trusting in man, whose breath is in his nostrils;<br/>for of what account is he?</p></blockquote></section>
