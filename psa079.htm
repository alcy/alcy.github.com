    <h1>Psalm 79</h1>

    <p class="psalm-subtitle">A Psalm by Asaph.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>God, the nations have come into your inheritance.<br/>They have defiled your holy temple.<br/>They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>They have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky,<br/>the flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>They have shed their blood like water around Jerusalem.<br/>There was no one to bury them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>We have become a reproach to our neighbors,<br/>a scoffing and derision to those who are around us.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>How long, LORD?<br/>Will you be angry forever?<br/>Will your jealousy burn like fire?<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you,<br/>on the kingdoms that don’t call on your name,<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>for they have devoured Jacob,<br/>and destroyed his homeland.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Don’t hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us.<br/>Let your tender mercies speedily meet us,<br/>for we are in desperate need.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Help us, God of our salvation, for the glory of your name.<br/>Deliver us, and forgive our sins, for your name’s sake.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?”<br/>Let it be known among the nations, before our eyes,<br/>that vengeance for your servants’ blood is being poured out.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you.<br/>According to the greatness of your power, preserve those who are sentenced to death.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Pay back to our neighbors seven times into their bosom<br/>their reproach with which they have reproached you, Lord.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>So we, your people and sheep of your pasture,<br/>will give you thanks forever.<br/>We will praise you forever, to all generations.</p></blockquote></section>
