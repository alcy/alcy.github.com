    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>“Man, who is born of a woman,<br/>is of few days, and full of trouble.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>He grows up like a flower, and is cut down.<br/>He also flees like a shadow, and doesn’t continue.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Do you open your eyes on such a one,<br/>and bring me into judgment with you?<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?<br/>Not one.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Seeing his days are determined,<br/>the number of his months is with you,<br/>and you have appointed his bounds that he can’t pass.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Look away from him, that he may rest,<br/>until he accomplishes, as a hireling, his day.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>“For there is hope for a tree if it is cut down,<br/>that it will sprout again,<br/>that the tender branch of it will not cease.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Though its root grows old in the earth,<br/>and its stock dies in the ground,<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>yet through the scent of water it will bud,<br/>and sprout boughs like a plant.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>But man dies, and is laid low.<br/>Yes, man gives up the spirit, and where is he?<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>As the waters fail from the sea,<br/>and the river wastes and dries up,<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>so man lies down and doesn’t rise.<br/>Until the heavens are no more, they will not awake,<br/>nor be roused out of their sleep.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>“Oh that you would hide me in Sheol,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="job-14-13-note-1">

            Sheol is the place of the dead.
            </span><br/>that you would keep me secret until your wrath is past,<br/>that you would appoint me a set time and remember me!<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>If a man dies, will he live again?<br/>I would wait all the days of my warfare,<br/>until my release should come.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>You would call, and I would answer you.<br/>You would have a desire for the work of your hands.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>But now you count my steps.<br/>Don’t you watch over my sin?<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>My disobedience is sealed up in a bag.<br/>You fasten up my iniquity.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>“But the mountain falling comes to nothing.<br/>The rock is removed out of its place.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>The waters wear the stones.<br/>The torrents of it wash away the dust of the earth.<br/>So you destroy the hope of man.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>You forever prevail against him, and he departs.<br/>You change his face, and send him away.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>His sons come to honor, and he doesn’t know it.<br/>They are brought low, but he doesn’t perceive it of them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>But his flesh on him has pain,<br/>and his soul within him mourns.”</p></blockquote></section>
