    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Hear the LORD’s word, you children of Israel,</p><blockquote><p>for the LORD has a charge against the inhabitants of the land:<br/>“Indeed there is no truth, nor goodness,<br/>nor knowledge of God in the land.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>There is cursing, lying, murder, stealing, and committing adultery;<br/>they break boundaries, and bloodshed causes bloodshed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Therefore the land will mourn,<br/>and everyone who dwells in it will waste away,<br/>with all living things in her,<br/>even the animals of the field and the birds of the sky;<br/>yes, the fish of the sea also die.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>“Yet let no man bring a charge, neither let any man accuse;<br/>for your people are like those who bring charges against a priest.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>You will stumble in the day,<br/>and the prophet will also stumble with you in the night;<br/>and I will destroy your mother.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.<br/>Because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you,<br/>that you may be no priest to me.<br/>Because you have forgotten your God’s law,<br/>I will also forget your children.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me.<br/>I will change their glory into shame.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>They feed on the sin of my people,<br/>and set their heart on their iniquity.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>It will be like people, like priest;<br/>and I will punish them for their ways,<br/>and will repay them for their deeds.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>They will eat, and not have enough.<br/>They will play the prostitute, and will not increase;<br/>because they have abandoned listening to the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Prostitution, wine, and new wine take away understanding.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>My people consult with their wooden idol,<br/>and answer to a stick of wood.<br/>Indeed the spirit of prostitution has led them astray,<br/>and they have been unfaithful to their God.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains,<br/>and burn incense on the hills, under oaks, poplars, and terebinths,<br/>because its shade is good.<br/>Therefore your daughters play the prostitute,<br/>and your brides commit adultery.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>I will not punish your daughters when they play the prostitute,<br/>nor your brides when they commit adultery;<br/>because the men consort with prostitutes,<br/>and they sacrifice with the shrine prostitutes;<br/>so the people without understanding will come to ruin.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>“Though you, Israel, play the prostitute,<br/>yet don’t let Judah offend;<br/>and don’t come to Gilgal,<br/>neither go up to Beth Aven,<br/>nor swear, ‘As the LORD lives.’<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>For Israel has behaved extremely stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer.<br/>Then how will the LORD feed them like a lamb in a meadow?<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Ephraim is joined to idols.<br/>Leave him alone!<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Their drink has become sour.<br/>They play the prostitute continually.<br/>Her rulers dearly love their shameful way.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>The wind has wrapped her up in its wings;<br/>and they shall be disappointed because of their sacrifices.</p></blockquote></section>
