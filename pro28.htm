    <h1>The Proverbs</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 28</h2>
    
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>The wicked flee when no one pursues;<br/>but the righteous are as bold as a lion.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>In rebellion, a land has many rulers,<br/>but order is maintained by a man of understanding and knowledge.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>A needy man who oppresses the poor<br/>is like a driving rain which leaves no crops.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Those who forsake the law praise the wicked;<br/>but those who keep the law contend with them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Evil men don’t understand justice;<br/>but those who seek the LORD understand it fully.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Better is the poor who walks in his integrity<br/>than he who is perverse in his ways, and he is rich.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Whoever keeps the law is a wise son;<br/>but he who is a companion of gluttons shames his father.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>He who increases his wealth by excessive interest<br/>gathers it for one who has pity on the poor.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>He who turns away his ear from hearing the law,<br/>even his prayer is an abomination.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way,<br/>he will fall into his own trap;<br/>but the blameless will inherit good.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>The rich man is wise in his own eyes;<br/>but the poor who has understanding sees through him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>When the righteous triumph, there is great glory;<br/>but when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>He who conceals his sins doesn’t prosper,<br/>but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Blessed is the man who always fears;<br/>but one who hardens his heart falls into trouble.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>As a roaring lion or a charging bear,<br/>so is a wicked ruler over helpless people.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>A tyrannical ruler lacks judgment.<br/>One who hates ill-gotten gain will have long days.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>A man who is tormented by blood guilt will be a fugitive until death.<br/>No one will support him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Whoever walks blamelessly is kept safe;<br/>but one with perverse ways will fall suddenly.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>One who works his land will have an abundance of food;<br/>but one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>A faithful man is rich with blessings;<br/>but one who is eager to be rich will not go unpunished.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>To show partiality is not good,<br/>yet a man will do wrong for a piece of bread.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>A stingy man hurries after riches,<br/>and doesn’t know that poverty waits for him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>One who rebukes a man will afterward find more favor<br/>than one who flatters with the tongue.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Whoever robs his father or his mother and says, “It’s not wrong,”<br/>is a partner with a destroyer.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>One who is greedy stirs up strife;<br/>but one who trusts in the LORD will prosper.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>One who trusts in himself is a fool;<br/>but one who walks in wisdom is kept safe.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>One who gives to the poor has no lack;<br/>but one who closes his eyes will have many curses.<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>When the wicked rise, men hide themselves;<br/>but when they perish, the righteous thrive. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="pro29.htm">→</a></span></p></blockquote></section>
