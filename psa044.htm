    <p class="psalm-subtitle">For the Chief Musician. By the sons of Korah. A contemplative psalm.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>We have heard with our ears, God;<br/>our fathers have told us what work you did in their days,<br/>in the days of old.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>You drove out the nations with your hand,<br/>but you planted them.<br/>You afflicted the peoples,<br/>but you spread them abroad.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For they didn’t get the land in possession by their own sword,<br/>neither did their own arm save them;<br/>but your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face,<br/>because you were favorable to them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>God, you are my King.<br/>Command victories for Jacob!<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Through you, we will push down our adversaries.<br/>Through your name, we will tread down those who rise up against us.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>For I will not trust in my bow,<br/>neither will my sword save me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>But you have saved us from our adversaries,<br/>and have shamed those who hate us.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>In God we have made our boast all day long.<br/>We will give thanks to your name forever.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>But now you rejected us, and brought us to dishonor,<br/>and don’t go out with our armies.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>You make us turn back from the adversary.<br/>Those who hate us take plunder for themselves.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>You have made us like sheep for food,<br/>and have scattered us among the nations.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>You sell your people for nothing,<br/>and have gained nothing from their sale.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>You make us a reproach to our neighbors,<br/>a scoffing and a derision to those who are around us.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>You make us a byword among the nations,<br/>a shaking of the head among the peoples.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>All day long my dishonor is before me,<br/>and shame covers my face,<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>at the taunt of one who reproaches and verbally abuses,<br/>because of the enemy and the avenger.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>All this has come on us,<br/>yet we haven’t forgotten you.<br/>We haven’t been false to your covenant.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Our heart has not turned back,<br/>neither have our steps strayed from your path,<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>though you have crushed us in the haunt of jackals,<br/>and covered us with the shadow of death.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>If we have forgotten the name of our God,<br/>or spread out our hands to a strange god,<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>won’t God search this out?<br/>For he knows the secrets of the heart.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Yes, for your sake we are killed all day long.<br/>We are regarded as sheep for the slaughter.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Wake up!<br/>Why do you sleep, Lord?<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="psa-44-23-note-1">

            The word translated “Lord” is “Adonai.”
            </span><br/>Arise!<br/>Don’t reject us forever.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Why do you hide your face,<br/>and forget our affliction and our oppression?<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>For our soul is bowed down to the dust.<br/>Our body clings to the earth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>Rise up to help us.<br/>Redeem us for your loving kindness’ sake.</p></blockquote></section>
