    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>“Come down and sit in the dust, virgin daughter of Babylon.</p><blockquote><p>Sit on the ground without a throne, daughter of the Chaldeans.<br/>For you will no longer be called tender and delicate.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Take the millstones and grind flour.<br/>Remove your veil, lift up your skirt, uncover your legs,<br/>and wade through the rivers.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Your nakedness will be uncovered.<br/>Yes, your shame will be seen.<br/>I will take vengeance,<br/>and will spare no one.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Our Redeemer, the LORD of Armies is his name,<br/>is the Holy One of Israel.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>“Sit in silence, and go into darkness,<br/>daughter of the Chaldeans.<br/>For you shall no longer be called<br/>the mistress of kingdoms.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>I was angry with my people.<br/>I profaned my inheritance<br/>and gave them into your hand.<br/>You showed them no mercy.<br/>You laid a very heavy yoke on the aged.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>You said, ‘I will be a princess forever,’<br/>so that you didn’t lay these things to your heart,<br/>nor did you remember the results.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>“Now therefore hear this, you who are given to pleasures,<br/>who sit securely,<br/>who say in your heart,<br/>‘I am, and there is no one else besides me.<br/>I won’t sit as a widow,<br/>neither will I know the loss of children.’<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>But these two things will come to you in a moment in one day:<br/>the loss of children and widowhood.<br/>They will come on you in their full measure,<br/>in the multitude of your sorceries,<br/>and the great abundance of your enchantments.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>For you have trusted in your wickedness.<br/>You have said, ‘No one sees me.’<br/>Your wisdom and your knowledge has perverted you.<br/>You have said in your heart, ‘I am, and there is no one else besides me.’<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Therefore disaster will come on you.<br/>You won’t know when it dawns.<br/>Mischief will fall on you.<br/>You won’t be able to put it away.<br/>Desolation will come on you suddenly,<br/>which you don’t understand.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>“Stand now with your enchantments<br/>and with the multitude of your sorceries,<br/>in which you have labored from your youth,<br/>as if you might profit,<br/>as if you might prevail.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>You are wearied in the multitude of your counsels.<br/>Now let the astrologers, the stargazers, and the monthly prognosticators stand up and save you from the things that will happen to you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Behold, they are like stubble.<br/>The fire will burn them.<br/>They won’t deliver themselves from the power of the flame.<br/>It won’t be a coal to warm at<br/>or a fire to sit by.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>The things that you labored in will be like this:<br/>those who have trafficked with you from your youth will each wander in his own way.<br/>There will be no one to save you.</p></blockquote></section>
