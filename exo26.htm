The loops shall be opposite one another.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>You shall make fifty clasps of gold, and couple the curtains to one another with the clasps. The tabernacle shall be a unit.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>“You shall make curtains of goats’ hair for a covering over the tabernacle.

The veil shall separate the holy place from the most holy for you.   <span class="verse" id="V34"></span>You shall put the mercy seat on the ark of the covenant in the most holy place.   <span class="verse" id="V35"></span>You shall set the table outside the veil, and the lamp stand opposite the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south. You shall put the table on the north side.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V36"></span>“You shall make a screen for the door of the Tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the embroiderer.   <span class="verse" id="V37"></span>You shall make for the screen five pillars of acacia, and overlay them with gold. Their hooks shall be of gold. You shall cast five sockets of bronze for them. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="exo27.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
