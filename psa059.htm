    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Deliver me from my enemies, my God.<br/>Set me on high from those who rise up against me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Deliver me from the workers of iniquity.<br/>Save me from the bloodthirsty men.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For, behold, they lie in wait for my soul.<br/>The mighty gather themselves together against me,<br/>not for my disobedience, nor for my sin, LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>I have done no wrong, yet they are ready to attack me.<br/>Rise up, behold, and help me!<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>You, LORD God of Armies, the God of Israel,<br/>rouse yourself to punish the nations.<br/>Show no mercy to the wicked traitors.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>They return at evening, howling like dogs,<br/>and prowl around the city.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Behold, they spew with their mouth.<br/>Swords are in their lips,<br/>“For”, they say, “who hears us?”<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>But you, LORD, laugh at them.<br/>You scoff at all the nations.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Oh, my Strength, I watch for you,<br/>for God is my high tower.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>My God will go before me with his loving kindness.<br/>God will let me look at my enemies in triumph.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Don’t kill them, or my people may forget.<br/>Scatter them by your power, and bring them down, Lord our shield.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips,<br/>let them be caught in their pride,<br/>for the curses and lies which they utter.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Consume them in wrath.<br/>Consume them, and they will be no more.<br/>Let them know that God rules in Jacob,<br/>to the ends of the earth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>At evening let them return.<br/>Let them howl like a dog, and go around the city.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>They shall wander up and down for food,<br/>and wait all night if they aren’t satisfied.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>But I will sing of your strength.<br/>Yes, I will sing aloud of your loving kindness in the morning.<br/>For you have been my high tower,<br/>a refuge in the day of my distress.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>To you, my strength, I will sing praises.<br/>For God is my high tower, the God of my mercy.</p></blockquote></section>
