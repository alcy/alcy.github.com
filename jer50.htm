    <h2>Chapter 50</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>The word that the LORD spoke concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, by Jeremiah the prophet.</p><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>“Declare among the nations and publish,<br/>and set up a standard;<br/>publish, and don’t conceal;<br/>say, ‘Babylon has been taken,<br/>Bel is disappointed,<br/>Merodach is dismayed!<br/>Her images are disappointed.<br/>Her idols are dismayed.’<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For a nation comes up out of the north against her,<br/>which will make her land desolate,<br/>and no one will dwell in it.<br/>They have fled.<br/>They are gone,<br/>both man and animal.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>“In those days, and in that time,” says the LORD,<br/>“the children of Israel will come,<br/>they and the children of Judah together;<br/>they will go on their way weeping,<br/>and will seek the LORD their God.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>They will inquire concerning Zion with their faces turned toward it,<br/>saying, ‘Come, and join yourselves to the LORD in an everlasting covenant<br/>that will not be forgotten.’<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>My people have been lost sheep.<br/>Their shepherds have caused them to go astray.<br/>They have turned them away on the mountains.<br/>They have gone from mountain to hill.<br/>They have forgotten their resting place.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>All who found them have devoured them.<br/>Their adversaries said, ‘We are not guilty,<br/>because they have sinned against the LORD,<br/>the habitation of righteousness,<br/>even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.’<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>“Flee out of the middle of Babylon!<br/>Go out of the land of the Chaldeans,<br/>and be as the male goats before the flocks.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>For, behold, I will stir up<br/>and cause to come up against Babylon a company of great nations from the north country;<br/>and they will set themselves in array against her.<br/>She will be taken from there.<br/>Their arrows will be as of an expert mighty man.<br/>None of them will return in vain.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Chaldea will be a prey.<br/>All who prey on her will be satisfied,” says the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>“Because you are glad,<br/>because you rejoice,<br/>O you who plunder my heritage,<br/>because you are wanton as a heifer that treads out the grain,<br/>and neigh as strong horses,<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>your mother will be utterly disappointed.<br/>She who bore you will be confounded.<br/>Behold, she will be the least of the nations,<br/>a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Because of the LORD’s wrath she won’t be inhabited,<br/>but she will be wholly desolate.<br/>Everyone who goes by Babylon will be astonished,<br/>and hiss at all her plagues.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Set yourselves in array against Babylon all around,<br/>all you who bend the bow;<br/>shoot at her.<br/>Spare no arrows,<br/>for she has sinned against the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Shout against her all around.<br/>She has submitted herself.<br/>Her bulwarks have fallen.<br/>Her walls have been thrown down,<br/>for it is the vengeance of the LORD.<br/>Take vengeance on her.<br/>As she has done, do to her.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Cut off the sower from Babylon,<br/>and him who handles the sickle in the time of harvest.<br/>For fear of the oppressing sword,<br/>they will each return to their own people,<br/>and they will each flee to their own land.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>“Israel is a hunted sheep.<br/>The lions have driven him away.<br/>First, the king of Assyria devoured him,<br/>and now at last Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has broken his bones.”</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Therefore the LORD of Armies, the God of Israel, says:</p><blockquote><p>“Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land,<br/>as I have punished the king of Assyria.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>I will bring Israel again to his pasture,<br/>and he will feed on Carmel and Bashan.<br/>His soul will be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>In those days, and in that time,” says the LORD,<br/>“the iniquity of Israel will be sought for,<br/>and there will be none,<br/>also the sins of Judah,<br/>and they won’t be found;<br/>for I will pardon them whom I leave as a remnant.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>“Go up against the land of Merathaim,<br/>even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod.<br/>Kill and utterly destroy after them,” says the LORD,<br/>“and do according to all that I have commanded you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>A sound of battle is in the land,<br/>and of great destruction.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>How the hammer of the whole earth is cut apart and broken!<br/>How Babylon has become a desolation among the nations!<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>I have laid a snare for you,<br/>and you are also taken, Babylon,<br/>and you weren’t aware.<br/>You are found,<br/>and also caught,<br/>because you have fought against the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>The LORD has opened his armory,<br/>and has brought out the weapons of his indignation;<br/>for the Lord, GOD<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="jer-50-25-note-1">
