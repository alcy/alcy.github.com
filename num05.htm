The priest shall have in his hand the water of bitterness that brings a curse.   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>The priest shall cause her to take an oath and shall tell the woman, “If no man has lain with you, and if you haven’t gone aside to uncleanness, being under your husband’s authority, be free from this water of bitterness that brings a curse.   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>But if you have gone astray, being under your husband’s authority, and if you are defiled, and some man has lain with you besides your husband—”   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>then the priest shall cause the woman to swear with the oath of cursing, and the priest shall tell the woman, “May the LORD make you a curse and an oath among your people, when the LORD allows your thigh to fall away, and your body to swell;   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>and this water that brings a curse will go into your bowels, and make your body swell, and your thigh fall away.” The woman shall say, “Amen, Amen.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>“ ‘The priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall wipe them into the water of bitterness.   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>He shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that causes the curse; and the water that causes the curse shall enter into her and become bitter.   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>The priest shall take the meal offering of jealousy out of the woman’s hand, and shall wave the meal offering before the LORD, and bring it to the altar.   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>The priest shall take a handful of the meal offering, as its memorial portion, and burn it on the altar, and afterward shall make the woman drink the water.   <span class="verse" id="V27"></span>When he has made her drink the water, then it shall happen, if she is defiled and has committed a trespass against her husband, that the water that causes the curse will enter into her and become bitter, and her body will swell, and her thigh will fall away; and the woman will be a curse among her people.   <span class="verse" id="V28"></span>If the woman isn’t defiled, but is clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive offspring.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="num-5-28-note-1">
