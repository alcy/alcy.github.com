    <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>When Solomon had finished the building of the LORD’s house, the king’s house, and all Solomon’s desire which he was pleased to do,   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>The LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>The LORD said to him, “I have heard your prayer and your supplication that you have made before me. I have made this house holy, which you have built, to put my name there forever; and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>As for you, if you will walk before me as David your father walked, in integrity of heart and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you, and will keep my statutes and my ordinances,   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, as I promised to David your father, saying, ‘There shall not fail from you a man on the throne of Israel.’   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>But if you turn away from following me, you or your children, and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods and worship them,   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>then I will cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and I will cast this house, which I have made holy for my name, out of my sight; and Israel will be a proverb and a byword among all peoples.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Though this house is so high, yet everyone who passes by it will be astonished and hiss; and they will say, ‘Why has the LORD done this to this land and to this house?’   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>and they will answer, ‘Because they abandoned the LORD their God, who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and embraced other gods, and worshiped them, and served them. Therefore the LORD has brought all this evil on them.’ ”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>At the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the two houses, the LORD’s house and the king’s house   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>(now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and cypress trees, and with gold, according to all his desire), King Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Hiram came out of Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they didn’t please him.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>He said, “What cities are these which you have given me, my brother?” He called them the land of Cabul<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="1ki-9-13-note-1">

        “Cabul” sounds like Hebrew for “good-for-nothing”.

        A talent is about 30 kilograms or 66 pounds or 965 Troy ounces, so 120 talents is about 3.6 metric tons

Then he built Millo.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he built to the LORD three times per year, burning incense with them on the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished the house.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>King Solomon made a fleet of ships in Ezion Geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.   <span class="verse" id="V27"></span>Hiram sent in the fleet his servants, sailors who had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.   <span class="verse" id="V28"></span>They came to Ophir, and fetched from there gold, four hundred and twenty talents,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="1ki-9-28-note-1">
