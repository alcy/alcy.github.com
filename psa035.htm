    <h1>Psalm 35</h1>

    <p class="psalm-subtitle">By David.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Contend, LORD, with those who contend with me.<br/>Fight against those who fight against me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Take hold of shield and buckler,<br/>and stand up for my help.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Brandish the spear and block those who pursue me.<br/>Tell my soul, “I am your salvation.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Let those who seek after my soul be disappointed and brought to dishonor.<br/>Let those who plot my ruin be turned back and confounded.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Let them be as chaff before the wind,<br/>the LORD’s angel driving them on.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Let their way be dark and slippery,<br/>the LORD’s angel pursuing them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>For without cause they have hidden their net in a pit for me.<br/>Without cause they have dug a pit for my soul.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Let destruction come on him unawares.<br/>Let his net that he has hidden catch himself.<br/>Let him fall into that destruction.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>My soul shall be joyful in the LORD.<br/>It shall rejoice in his salvation.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>All my bones shall say, “LORD, who is like you,<br/>who delivers the poor from him who is too strong for him;<br/>yes, the poor and the needy from him who robs him?”<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Unrighteous witnesses rise up.<br/>They ask me about things that I don’t know about.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>They reward me evil for good,<br/>to the bereaving of my soul.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth.<br/>I afflicted my soul with fasting.<br/>My prayer returned into my own bosom.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother.<br/>I bowed down mourning, as one who mourns his mother.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>But in my adversity, they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together.<br/>The attackers gathered themselves together against me, and I didn’t know it.<br/>They tore at me, and didn’t cease.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Like the profane mockers in feasts,<br/>they gnashed their teeth at me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Lord, how long will you look on?<br/>Rescue my soul from their destruction,<br/>my precious life from the lions.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>I will give you thanks in the great assembly.<br/>I will praise you among many people.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Don’t let those who are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me;<br/>neither let those who hate me without a cause wink their eyes.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>For they don’t speak peace,<br/>but they devise deceitful words against those who are quiet in the land.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Yes, they opened their mouth wide against me.<br/>They said, “Aha! Aha! Our eye has seen it!”<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>You have seen it, LORD. Don’t keep silent.<br/>Lord, don’t be far from me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Wake up! Rise up to defend me, my God!<br/>My Lord, contend for me!<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Vindicate me, LORD my God, according to your righteousness.<br/>Don’t let them gloat over me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>Don’t let them say in their heart, “Aha! That’s the way we want it!”<br/>Don’t let them say, “We have swallowed him up!”<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>Let them be disappointed and confounded together who rejoice at my calamity.<br/>Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor who magnify themselves against me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>Let those who favor my righteous cause shout for joy and be glad.<br/>Yes, let them say continually, “May the LORD be magnified,<br/>who has pleasure in the prosperity of his servant!”<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>My tongue shall talk about your righteousness and about your praise all day long.</p></blockquote></section>
