    <h1>Paul's Second Letter to the Corinthians</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>It is doubtless not profitable for me to boast, but I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>I know a man in Christ who was caught up into the third heaven fourteen years ago—whether in the body, I don’t know, or whether out of the body, I don’t know; God knows.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>I know such a man (whether in the body, or outside of the body, I don’t know; God knows),   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>how he was caught up into Paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>For if I would desire to boast, I will not be foolish; for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me or hears from me.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>By reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted excessively, a thorn in the flesh was given to me: a messenger of Satan to torment me, that I should not be exalted excessively.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Concerning this thing, I begged the Lord three times that it might depart from me.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>He has said to me, <span class="wj">“My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.”</span> Most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest on me.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, and in distresses, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>I have become foolish in boasting. You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for I am in no way inferior to the very best apostles, though I am nothing.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all perseverance, in signs and wonders and mighty works.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>For what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies, unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!</p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I seek not your possessions, but you. For the children ought not to save up for the parents, but the parents for the children.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Even so, I myself didn’t burden you. But you might say that being crafty, I caught you with deception.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Did I take advantage of you by anyone of those whom I have sent to you?   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Didn’t we walk in the same spirit? Didn’t we walk in the same steps?</p><p><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Again, do you think that we are excusing ourselves to you? In the sight of God we speak in Christ. But all things, beloved, are for your edifying.   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>For I am afraid that perhaps when I come, I might find you not the way I want to, and that I might be found by you as you don’t desire, that perhaps there would be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, whisperings, proud thoughts, or riots,   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>that again when I come my God would humble me before you, and I would mourn for many of those who have sinned before now, and not repented of the uncleanness, sexual immorality, and lustfulness which they committed.</p></section>
