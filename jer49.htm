    <h2>Chapter 49</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Of the children of Ammon. The LORD says:</p><blockquote><p>“Has Israel no sons?<br/>Has he no heir?<br/>Why then does Malcam possess Gad,<br/>and his people dwell in its cities?<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Therefore behold, the days come,”<br/>says the LORD,<br/>“that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the children of Ammon,<br/>and it will become a desolate heap,<br/>and her daughters will be burned with fire;<br/>then Israel will possess those who possessed him,”<br/>says the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>“Wail, Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste!<br/>Cry, you daughters of Rabbah!<br/>Clothe yourself in sackcloth.<br/>Lament, and run back and forth among the fences;<br/>for Malcam will go into captivity,<br/>his priests and his princes together.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Why do you boast in the valleys,<br/>your flowing valley, backsliding daughter?<br/>You trusted in her treasures,<br/>saying, ‘Who will come to me?’<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Behold, I will bring a terror on you,”<br/>says the Lord, GOD of Armies,<br/>“from all who are around you.<br/>All of you will be driven completely out,<br/>and there will be no one to gather together the fugitives.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>“But afterward I will reverse the captivity of the children of Ammon,”<br/>says the LORD.</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Of Edom, the LORD of Armies says:</p><blockquote><p>“Is wisdom no more in Teman?<br/>Has counsel perished from the prudent?<br/>Has their wisdom vanished?<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Flee! Turn back!<br/>Dwell in the depths, inhabitants of Dedan;<br/>for I will bring the calamity of Esau on him when I visit him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>If grape gatherers came to you,<br/>would they not leave some gleaning grapes?<br/>If thieves came by night,<br/>wouldn’t they steal until they had enough?<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>But I have made Esau bare,<br/>I have uncovered his secret places,<br/>and he will not be able to hide himself.<br/>His offspring is destroyed,<br/>with his brothers and his neighbors;<br/>and he is no more.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Leave your fatherless children.<br/>I will preserve them alive.<br/>Let your widows trust in me.”</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>For the LORD says: “Behold, they to whom it didn’t pertain to drink of the cup will certainly drink; and are you he who will altogether go unpunished? You won’t go unpunished, but you will surely drink.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>For I have sworn by myself,” says the LORD, “that Bozrah will become an astonishment, a reproach, a waste, and a curse. All its cities will be perpetual wastes.”</p><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>I have heard news from the LORD,<br/>and an ambassador is sent among the nations,<br/>saying, “Gather yourselves together!<br/>Come against her!<br/>Rise up to the battle!”<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>“For, behold, I have made you small among the nations,<br/>and despised among men.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>As for your terror,<br/>the pride of your heart has deceived you,<br/>O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock,<br/>who hold the height of the hill,<br/>though you should make your nest as high as the eagle,<br/>I will bring you down from there,” says the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>“Edom will become an astonishment.<br/>Everyone who passes by it will be astonished,<br/>and will hiss at all its plagues.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and its neighbor cities,” says the LORD,<br/>“no man will dwell there,<br/>neither will any son of man live therein.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>“Behold, he will come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation;<br/>for I will suddenly make them run away from it,<br/>and whoever is chosen,<br/>I will appoint him over it.<br/>For who is like me?<br/>Who will appoint me a time?<br/>Who is the shepherd who will stand before me?”<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he has taken against Edom,<br/>and his purposes that he has purposed against the inhabitants of Teman:<br/>Surely they will drag them away,<br/>the little ones of the flock.<br/>Surely he will make their habitation desolate over them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>The earth trembles at the noise of their fall;<br/>there is a cry, the noise which is heard in the Red Sea.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Behold, he will come up and fly as the eagle,<br/>and spread out his wings against Bozrah.<br/>The heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day will be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Of Damascus:</p><blockquote><p>“Hamath and Arpad are confounded,<br/>for they have heard evil news.<br/>They have melted away.<br/>There is sorrow on the sea.<br/>It can’t be quiet.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Damascus has grown feeble,<br/>she turns herself to flee,<br/>and trembling has seized her.<br/>Anguish and sorrows have taken hold of her,<br/>as of a woman in travail.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>How is the city of praise not forsaken,<br/>the city of my joy?<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>Therefore her young men will fall in her streets,<br/>and all the men of war will be brought to silence in that day,”<br/>says the LORD of Armies.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>“I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus,<br/>and it will devour the palaces of Ben Hadad.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>Of Kedar, and of the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck, The LORD says:<br/>“Arise, go up to Kedar,<br/>and destroy the children of the east.<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>They will take their tents and their flocks.<br/>they will carry away for themselves their curtains,<br/>all their vessels, and their camels;<br/>and they will cry to them, ‘Terror on every side!’<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>Flee!<br/>Wander far off!<br/>Dwell in the depths, you inhabitants of Hazor,” says the LORD;<br/>“for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has taken counsel against you,<br/>and has conceived a purpose against you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>Arise! Go up to a nation that is at ease,<br/>that dwells without care,” says the LORD;<br/>“that has neither gates nor bars,<br/>that dwells alone.<br/><span class="verse" id="V32"></span>Their camels will be a booty,<br/>and the multitude of their livestock a plunder.<br/>I will scatter to all winds those who have the corners of their beards cut off;<br/>and I will bring their calamity from every side of them,”<br/>says the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V33"></span>Hazor will be a dwelling place of jackals,<br/>a desolation forever.<br/>No man will dwell there,<br/>neither will any son of man live therein.”</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V34"></span>The LORD’s word that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V35"></span>“The LORD of Armies says:</p><blockquote><p>‘Behold, I will break the bow of Elam,<br/>the chief of their might.<br/><span class="verse" id="V36"></span>I will bring on Elam the four winds from the four quarters of the sky,<br/>and will scatter them toward all those winds.<br/>There will be no nation where the outcasts of Elam will not come.<br/><span class="verse" id="V37"></span>I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies,<br/>and before those who seek their life.<br/>I will bring evil on them, even my fierce anger,’ says the LORD;<br/>‘and I will send the sword after them,<br/>until I have consumed them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V38"></span>I will set my throne in Elam,<br/>and will destroy from there king and princes,’ says the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V39"></span>‘But it will happen in the latter days<br/>that I will reverse the captivity of Elam,’ says the LORD.” <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="jer50.htm">→</a></span></p></blockquote></section>
