    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Behold, a day of the LORD comes, when your plunder will be divided within you.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city will be taken, the houses rifled, and the women ravished. Half of the city will go out into captivity, and the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Then the LORD will go out and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>His feet will stand in that day on the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in two from east to west, making a very great valley. Half of the mountain will move toward the north, and half of it toward the south.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>You shall flee by the valley of my mountains, for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azel. Yes, you shall flee, just like you fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. The LORD my God will come, and all the holy ones with you.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="zec-14-5-note-1">

In that day the LORD will be one, and his name one.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>All the land will be made like the Arabah, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; and she will be lifted up and will dwell in her place, from Benjamin’s gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananel to the king’s wine presses.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Men will dwell therein, and there will be no more curse; but Jerusalem will dwell safely.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>This will be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples who have fought against Jerusalem: their flesh will consume away while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will consume away in their sockets, and their tongue will consume away in their mouth.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>It will happen in that day that a great panic from the LORD will be among them; and they will each seize the hand of his neighbor, and his hand will rise up against the hand of his neighbor.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered together: gold, silver, and clothing, in great abundance.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>A plague like this will fall on the horse, on the mule, on the camel, on the donkey, and on all the animals that will be in those camps.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>It will happen that everyone who is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of Armies, and to keep the feast of booths.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>It will be that whoever of all the families of the earth doesn’t go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of Armies, on them there will be no rain.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>If the family of Egypt doesn’t go up and doesn’t come, neither will it rain on them.
