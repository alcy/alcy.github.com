    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>The righteous perish,<br/>and no one lays it to heart.<br/>Merciful men are taken away,<br/>and no one considers that the righteous is taken away from the evil.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>He enters into peace.<br/>They rest in their beds,<br/>each one who walks in his uprightness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>“But draw near here, you sons of a sorceress,<br/>you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Whom do you mock?<br/>Against whom do you make a wide mouth<br/>and stick out your tongue?<br/>Aren’t you children of disobedience<br/>and offspring of falsehood,<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>you who inflame yourselves among the oaks,<br/>under every green tree;<br/>who kill the children in the valleys,<br/>under the clefts of the rocks?<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Among the smooth stones of the valley is your portion.<br/>They, they are your lot.<br/>You have even poured a drink offering to them.<br/>You have offered an offering.<br/>Shall I be appeased for these things?<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>On a high and lofty mountain you have set your bed.<br/>You also went up there to offer sacrifice.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>You have set up your memorial behind the doors and the posts,<br/>for you have exposed yourself to someone besides me,<br/>and have gone up.<br/>You have enlarged your bed<br/>and made a covenant for yourself with them.<br/>You loved what you saw on their bed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>You went to the king with oil,<br/>increased your perfumes,<br/>sent your ambassadors far off,<br/>and degraded yourself even to Sheol.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="isa-57-9-note-1">
