    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Bel bows down.<br/>Nebo stoops.<br/>Their idols are carried by animals,<br/>and on the livestock.<br/>The things that you carried around are heavy loads,<br/>a burden for the weary.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>They stoop and they bow down together.<br/>They could not deliver the burden,<br/>but they have gone into captivity.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>“Listen to me, house of Jacob,<br/>and all the remnant of the house of Israel,<br/>that have been carried from their birth,<br/>that have been carried from the womb.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Even to old age I am he,<br/>and even to gray hairs I will carry you.<br/>I have made, and I will bear.<br/>Yes, I will carry, and will deliver.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>“To whom will you compare me, and consider my equal,<br/>and compare me, as if we were the same?<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Some pour out gold from the bag,<br/>and weigh silver in the balance.<br/>They hire a goldsmith,<br/>and he makes it a god.<br/>They fall down—<br/>yes, they worship.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>They bear it on their shoulder.<br/>They carry it, and set it in its place, and it stands there.<br/>It cannot move from its place.<br/>Yes, one may cry to it, yet it can not answer.<br/>It cannot save him out of his trouble.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>“Remember this, and show yourselves men.<br/>Bring it to mind again, you transgressors.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Remember the former things of old;<br/>for I am God, and there is no other.<br/>I am God, and there is none like me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>I declare the end from the beginning,<br/>and from ancient times things that are not yet done.<br/>I say: My counsel will stand,<br/>and I will do all that I please.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>I call a ravenous bird from the east,<br/>the man of my counsel from a far country.<br/>Yes, I have spoken.<br/>I will also bring it to pass.<br/>I have planned.<br/>I will also do it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Listen to me, you stubborn-hearted,<br/>who are far from righteousness!<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>I bring my righteousness near.<br/>It is not far off,<br/>and my salvation will not wait.<br/>I will grant salvation to Zion,<br/>my glory to Israel.</p></blockquote></section>
