They bear their young.<br/>They end their labor pains.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Their young ones become strong.<br/>They grow up in the open field.<br/>They go out, and don’t return again.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>“Who has set the wild donkey free?<br/>Or who has loosened the bonds of the swift donkey,<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>whose home I have made the wilderness,<br/>and the salt land his dwelling place?<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>He scorns the tumult of the city,<br/>neither does he hear the shouting of the driver.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>The range of the mountains is his pasture.<br/>He searches after every green thing.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>“Will the wild ox be content to serve you?<br/>Or will he stay by your feeding trough?<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Can you hold the wild ox in the furrow with his harness?<br/>Or will he till the valleys after you?<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Will you trust him, because his strength is great?<br/>Or will you leave to him your labor?<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Will you confide in him, that he will bring home your seed,<br/>and gather the grain of your threshing floor?<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>“The wings of the ostrich wave proudly,<br/>but are they the feathers and plumage of love?<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>For she leaves her eggs on the earth,<br/>warms them in the dust,<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>and forgets that the foot may crush them,<br/>or that the wild animal may trample them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>She deals harshly with her young ones, as if they were not hers.<br/>Though her labor is in vain, she is without fear,<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>because God has deprived her of wisdom,<br/>neither has he imparted to her understanding.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>When she lifts up herself on high,<br/>she scorns the horse and his rider.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>“Have you given the horse might?<br/>Have you clothed his neck with a quivering mane?<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Have you made him to leap as a locust?<br/>The glory of his snorting is awesome.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>He paws in the valley, and rejoices in his strength.<br/>He goes out to meet the armed men.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>He mocks at fear, and is not dismayed,<br/>neither does he turn back from the sword.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>The quiver rattles against him,<br/>the flashing spear and the javelin.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>He eats up the ground with fierceness and rage,<br/>neither does he stand still at the sound of the trumpet.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>As often as the trumpet sounds he snorts, ‘Aha!’<br/>He smells the battle afar off,<br/>the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>“Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars,<br/>and stretches her wings toward the south?<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up,<br/>and makes his nest on high?<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>On the cliff he dwells and makes his home,<br/>on the point of the cliff and the stronghold.<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>From there he spies out the prey.<br/>His eyes see it afar off.<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>His young ones also suck up blood.<br/>Where the slain are, there he is.” <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="job40.htm">→</a></span></p></blockquote></section>
