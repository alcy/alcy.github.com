            LORD or GOD in all caps is from the Hebrew יהוה Yahweh except when otherwise noted as being from the short form יה Yah.
            </span><br/>Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good,<br/>for his loving kindness endures forever.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD,<br/>or fully declare all his praise?<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Blessed are those who keep justice.<br/>Blessed is one who does what is right at all times.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Remember me, LORD, with the favor that you show to your people.<br/>Visit me with your salvation,<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>that I may see the prosperity of your chosen,<br/>that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation,<br/>that I may glory with your inheritance.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>We have sinned with our fathers.<br/>We have committed iniquity.<br/>We have done wickedly.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Our fathers didn’t understand your wonders in Egypt.<br/>They didn’t remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses,<br/>but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake,<br/>that he might make his mighty power known.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up;<br/>so he led them through the depths, as through a desert.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>He saved them from the hand of him who hated them,<br/>and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>The waters covered their adversaries.<br/>There was not one of them left.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Then they believed his words.<br/>They sang his praise.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>They soon forgot his works.<br/>They didn’t wait for his counsel,<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>but gave in to craving in the desert,<br/>and tested God in the wasteland.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>He gave them their request,<br/>but sent leanness into their soul.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>They envied Moses also in the camp,<br/>and Aaron, the LORD’s saint.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,<br/>and covered the company of Abiram.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>A fire was kindled in their company.<br/>The flame burned up the wicked.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>They made a calf in Horeb,<br/>and worshiped a molten image.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Thus they exchanged their glory<br/>for an image of a bull that eats grass.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>They forgot God, their Savior,<br/>who had done great things in Egypt,<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>wondrous works in the land of Ham,<br/>and awesome things by the Red Sea.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Therefore he said that he would destroy them,<br/>had Moses, his chosen, not stood before him in the breach,<br/>to turn away his wrath, so that he wouldn’t destroy them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Yes, they despised the pleasant land.<br/>They didn’t believe his word,<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>but murmured in their tents,<br/>and didn’t listen to the LORD’s voice.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>Therefore he swore to them<br/>that he would overthrow them in the wilderness,<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>that he would overthrow their offspring among the nations,<br/>and scatter them in the lands.<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>They joined themselves also to Baal Peor,<br/>and ate the sacrifices of the dead.<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds.<br/>The plague broke in on them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>Then Phinehas stood up and executed judgment,<br/>so the plague was stopped.<br/><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>That was credited to him for righteousness,<br/>for all generations to come.<br/><span class="verse" id="V32"></span>They angered him also at the waters of Meribah,<br/>so that Moses was troubled for their sakes;<br/><span class="verse" id="V33"></span>because they were rebellious against his spirit,<br/>he spoke rashly with his lips.<br/><span class="verse" id="V34"></span>They didn’t destroy the peoples,<br/>as the LORD commanded them,<br/><span class="verse" id="V35"></span>but mixed themselves with the nations,<br/>and learned their works.<br/><span class="verse" id="V36"></span>They served their idols,<br/>which became a snare to them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V37"></span>Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.<br/><span class="verse" id="V38"></span>They shed innocent blood,<br/>even the blood of their sons and of their daughters,<br/>whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan.<br/>The land was polluted with blood.<br/><span class="verse" id="V39"></span>Thus they were defiled with their works,<br/>and prostituted themselves in their deeds.<br/><span class="verse" id="V40"></span>Therefore the LORD burned with anger against his people.<br/>He abhorred his inheritance.<br/><span class="verse" id="V41"></span>He gave them into the hand of the nations.<br/>Those who hated them ruled over them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V42"></span>Their enemies also oppressed them.<br/>They were brought into subjection under their hand.<br/><span class="verse" id="V43"></span>He rescued them many times,<br/>but they were rebellious in their counsel,<br/>and were brought low in their iniquity.<br/><span class="verse" id="V44"></span>Nevertheless he regarded their distress,<br/>when he heard their cry.<br/><span class="verse" id="V45"></span>He remembered for them his covenant,<br/>and repented according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.<br/><span class="verse" id="V46"></span>He made them also to be pitied<br/>by all those who carried them captive.<br/><span class="verse" id="V47"></span>Save us, LORD, our God,<br/>gather us from among the nations,<br/>to give thanks to your holy name,<br/>to triumph in your praise!<br/><span class="verse" id="V48"></span>Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,<br/>from everlasting even to everlasting!<br/>Let all the people say, “Amen.”<br/>Praise the LORD!<label class="margin-toggle
