    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>“However, Job, please hear my speech,<br/>and listen to all my words.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>See now, I have opened my mouth.<br/>My tongue has spoken in my mouth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>My words will utter the uprightness of my heart.<br/>That which my lips know they will speak sincerely.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>The Spirit of God has made me,<br/>and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>If you can, answer me.<br/>Set your words in order before me, and stand up.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Behold, I am toward God even as you are.<br/>I am also formed out of the clay.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Behold, my terror will not make you afraid,<br/>neither will my pressure be heavy on you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>“Surely you have spoken in my hearing,<br/>I have heard the voice of your words, saying,<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>‘I am clean, without disobedience.<br/>I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Behold, he finds occasions against me.<br/>He counts me for his enemy.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>He puts my feet in the stocks.<br/>He marks all my paths.’<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>“Behold, I will answer you. In this you are not just,<br/>for God is greater than man.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Why do you strive against him,<br/>because he doesn’t give account of any of his matters?<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>For God speaks once,<br/>yes twice, though man pays no attention.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>In a dream, in a vision of the night,<br/>when deep sleep falls on men,<br/>in slumbering on the bed,<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>then he opens the ears of men,<br/>and seals their instruction,<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>that he may withdraw man from his purpose,<br/>and hide pride from man.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>He keeps back his soul from the pit,<br/>and his life from perishing by the sword.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>“He is chastened also with pain on his bed,<br/>with continual strife in his bones,<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>so that his life abhors bread,<br/>and his soul dainty food.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>His flesh is so consumed away that it can’t be seen.<br/>His bones that were not seen stick out.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Yes, his soul draws near to the pit,<br/>and his life to the destroyers.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>“If there is beside him an angel,<br/>an interpreter, one among a thousand,<br/>to show to man what is right for him,<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>then God is gracious to him, and says,<br/>‘Deliver him from going down to the pit,<br/>I have found a ransom.’<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>His flesh will be fresher than a child’s.<br/>He returns to the days of his youth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>He prays to God, and he is favorable to him,<br/>so that he sees his face with joy.<br/>He restores to man his righteousness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>He sings before men, and says,<br/>‘I have sinned, and perverted that which was right,<br/>and it didn’t profit me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>He has redeemed my soul from going into the pit.<br/>My life will see the light.’<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>“Behold, God does all these things,<br/>twice, yes three times, with a man,<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>to bring back his soul from the pit,<br/>that he may be enlightened with the light of the living.<br/><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>Mark well, Job, and listen to me.<br/>Hold your peace, and I will speak.<br/><span class="verse" id="V32"></span>If you have anything to say, answer me.<br/>Speak, for I desire to justify you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V33"></span>If not, listen to me.<br/>Hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom.” <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="job34.htm">→</a></span></p></blockquote></section>
