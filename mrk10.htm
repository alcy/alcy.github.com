Go, sell whatever you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me, taking up the cross.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>But his face fell at that saying, and he went away sorrowful, for he was one who had great possessions.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, <span class="wj">“How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter into God’s Kingdom!”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>The disciples were amazed at his words.

As he went out from Jericho with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the road.   <span class="verse" id="V47"></span>When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out and say, “Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me!”   <span class="verse" id="V48"></span>Many rebuked him, that he should be quiet, but he cried out much more, “You son of David, have mercy on me!”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V49"></span>Jesus stood still and said, <span class="wj">“Call him.”</span></p><p>They called the blind man, saying to him, “Cheer up! Get up. He is calling you!”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V50"></span>He, casting away his cloak, sprang up, and came to Jesus.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V51"></span>Jesus asked him, <span class="wj">“What do you want me to do for you?”</span></p><p>The blind man said to him, “Rabboni,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="mrk-10-51-note-1">
