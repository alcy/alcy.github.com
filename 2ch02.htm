This is an ordinance forever to Israel.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>“The house which I am building will be great, for our God is greater than all gods.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>But who is able to build him a house, since heaven and the heaven of heavens can’t contain him? Who am I then, that I should build him a house, except just to burn incense before him?</p><p><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>“Now therefore send me a man skillful to work in gold, in silver, in bronze, in iron, and in purple, crimson, and blue, and who knows how to engrave engravings, to be with the skillful men who are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father provided.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>“Send me also cedar trees, cypress trees, and algum trees out of Lebanon, for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon. Behold, my servants will be with your servants,   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>even to prepare me timber in abundance; for the house which I am about to build will be great and wonderful.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Behold, I will give to your servants, the cutters who cut timber, twenty thousand cors<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="2ch-2-10-note-1">
