    <h1>The Acts of the Apostles</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 18</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>After these things Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>He found a certain Jew named Aquila, a man of Pontus by race, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome. He came to them,   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>and because he practiced the same trade, he lived with them and worked, for by trade they were tent makers.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>He reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath and persuaded Jews and Greeks.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>When Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was compelled by the Spirit, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>When they opposed him and blasphemed, he shook out his clothing and said to them, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am clean. From now on, I will go to the Gentiles!”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>He departed there and went into the house of a certain man named Justus, one who worshiped God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house. Many of the Corinthians, when they heard, believed and were baptized.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>The Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision, <span class="wj">“Don’t be afraid, but speak and don’t be silent; </span> <span class="verse" id="V10"></span><span class="wj">for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many people in this city.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>He lived there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat,   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>saying, “This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, “If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked crime, you Jews, it would be reasonable that I should bear with you;   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>but if they are questions about words and names and your own law, look to it yourselves. For I don’t want to be a judge of these matters.”   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>So he drove them from the judgment seat.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Then all the Greeks seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. Gallio didn’t care about any of these things.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Paul, having stayed after this many more days, took his leave of the brothers,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="act-18-18-note-1">

        The word for “brothers” here and where the context allows may also be correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.”
        </span> and sailed from there for Syria, together with Priscilla and Aquila. He shaved his head in Cenchreae, for he had a vow.   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>He came to Ephesus, and he left them there; but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>When they asked him to stay with them a longer time, he declined;   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>but taking his leave of them, he said, “I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem, but I will return again to you if God wills.” Then he set sail from Ephesus.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the assembly, and went down to Antioch.   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Having spent some time there, he departed and went through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, in order, establishing all the disciples.   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus. He was mighty in the Scriptures.   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, although he knew only the baptism of John.   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside, and explained to him the way of God more accurately.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>When he had determined to pass over into Achaia, the brothers encouraged him; and wrote to the disciples to receive him. When he had come, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace;   <span class="verse" id="V28"></span>for he powerfully refuted the Jews, publicly showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</p></section>
