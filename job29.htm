    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Job again took up his parable, and said,</p><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>“Oh that I were as in the months of old,<br/>as in the days when God watched over me;<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>when his lamp shone on my head,<br/>and by his light I walked through darkness,<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>as I was in my prime,<br/>when the friendship of God was in my tent,<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>when the Almighty was yet with me,<br/>and my children were around me,<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>when my steps were washed with butter,<br/>and the rock poured out streams of oil for me,<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>when I went out to the city gate,<br/>when I prepared my seat in the street.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>The young men saw me and hid themselves.<br/>The aged rose up and stood.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>The princes refrained from talking,<br/>and laid their hand on their mouth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>The voice of the nobles was hushed,<br/>and their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me,<br/>and when the eye saw me, it commended me,<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>because I delivered the poor who cried,<br/>and the fatherless also, who had no one to help him,<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>the blessing of him who was ready to perish came on me,<br/>and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>I put on righteousness, and it clothed me.<br/>My justice was as a robe and a diadem.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>I was eyes to the blind,<br/>and feet to the lame.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>I was a father to the needy.<br/>I researched the cause of him whom I didn’t know.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>I broke the jaws of the unrighteous<br/>and plucked the prey out of his teeth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Then I said, ‘I will die in my own house,<br/>I will count my days as the sand.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>My root is spread out to the waters.<br/>The dew lies all night on my branch.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>My glory is fresh in me.<br/>My bow is renewed in my hand.’<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>“Men listened to me, waited,<br/>and kept silence for my counsel.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>After my words they didn’t speak again.<br/>My speech fell on them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>They waited for me as for the rain.<br/>Their mouths drank as with the spring rain.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>I smiled on them when they had no confidence.<br/>They didn’t reject the light of my face.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>I chose out their way, and sat as chief.<br/>I lived as a king in the army,<br/>as one who comforts the mourners.</p></blockquote></section>
