    <h1>The Lamentations of Jeremiah</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>How the gold has become dim!<br/>The most pure gold has changed!<br/>The stones of the sanctuary are poured out<br/>at the head of every street.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>The precious sons of Zion,<br/>comparable to fine gold,<br/>how they are esteemed as earthen pitchers,<br/>the work of the hands of the potter!<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Even the jackals offer their breast.<br/>They nurse their young ones.<br/>But the daughter of my people has become cruel,<br/>like the ostriches in the wilderness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>The tongue of the nursing child clings to the roof of his mouth for thirst.<br/>The young children ask for bread,<br/>and no one breaks it for them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Those who ate delicacies are desolate in the streets.<br/>Those who were brought up in purple embrace dunghills.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom,<br/>which was overthrown as in a moment.<br/>No hands were laid on her.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Her nobles were purer than snow.<br/>They were whiter than milk.<br/>They were more ruddy in body than rubies.<br/>Their polishing was like sapphire.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Their appearance is blacker than a coal.<br/>They are not known in the streets.<br/>Their skin clings to their bones.<br/>It is withered.<br/>It has become like wood.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Those who are killed with the sword are better than those who are killed with hunger;<br/>for these pine away, stricken through,<br/>for lack of the fruits of the field.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>The hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children.<br/>They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>The LORD has accomplished his wrath.<br/>He has poured out his fierce anger.<br/>He has kindled a fire in Zion,<br/>which has devoured its foundations.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>The kings of the earth didn’t believe,<br/>neither did all the inhabitants of the world,<br/>that the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>It is because of the sins of her prophets<br/>and the iniquities of her priests,<br/>that have shed the blood of the just in the middle of her.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>They wander as blind men in the streets.<br/>They are polluted with blood,<br/>So that men can’t touch their garments.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>“Go away!” they cried to them.<br/>“Unclean! Go away! Go away! Don’t touch!<br/>When they fled away and wandered, men said among the nations,<br/>“They can’t live here any more.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>The LORD’s anger has scattered them.<br/>He will not pay attention to them any more.<br/>They didn’t respect the persons of the priests.<br/>They didn’t favor the elders.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Our eyes still fail,<br/>looking in vain for our help.<br/>In our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>They hunt our steps,<br/>so that we can’t go in our streets.<br/>Our end is near.<br/>Our days are fulfilled,<br/>for our end has come.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the sky.<br/>They chased us on the mountains.<br/>They set an ambush for us in the wilderness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>The breath of our nostrils,<br/>the anointed of the LORD,<br/>was taken in their pits;<br/>of whom we said,<br/>under his shadow we will live among the nations.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Rejoice and be glad, daughter of Edom,<br/>who dwells in the land of Uz.<br/>The cup will pass through to you also.<br/>You will be drunken,<br/>and will make yourself naked.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>The punishment of your iniquity is accomplished, daughter of Zion.<br/>He will no more carry you away into captivity.<br/>He will visit your iniquity, daughter of Edom.<br/>He will uncover your sins.</p></blockquote></section>
