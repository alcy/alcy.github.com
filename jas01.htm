        The word for “brothers” here and where context allows may also be correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.”
        </span> when you fall into various temptations,   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Let endurance have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>But let him ask in faith, without any doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>For that man shouldn’t think that he will receive anything from the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>He is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his high position;   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>and the rich, in that he is made humble, because like the flower in the grass, he will pass away.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>For the sun arises with the scorching wind and withers the grass; and the flower in it falls, and the beauty of its appearance perishes. So the rich man will also fade away in his pursuits.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Blessed is a person who endures temptation, for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord promised to those who love him.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Let no man say when he is tempted, “I am tempted by God,” for God can’t be tempted by evil, and he himself tempts no one.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own lust and enticed.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Then the lust, when it has conceived, bears sin. The sin, when it is full grown, produces death.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Don’t be deceived, my beloved brothers.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation nor turning shadow.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Of his own will he gave birth to us by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>So, then, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger;   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>for the anger of man doesn’t produce the righteousness of God.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Therefore, putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with humility the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="jas-1-21-note-1">

        or, preserve your life.
        </span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>But be doers of the word, and not only hearers, deluding your own selves.   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror;   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>for he sees himself, and goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was.   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>But he who looks into the perfect law of freedom and continues, not being a hearer who forgets but a doer of the work, this man will be blessed in what he does.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>If anyone among you thinks himself to be religious while he doesn’t bridle his tongue, but deceives his heart, this man’s religion is worthless.   <span class="verse" id="V27"></span>Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained by the world. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="jas02.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
