    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Come near, you nations, to hear!<br/>Listen, you peoples.<br/>Let the earth and all it contains hear,<br/>the world, and everything that comes from it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>For the LORD is enraged against all the nations,<br/>and angry with all their armies.<br/>He has utterly destroyed them.<br/>He has given them over for slaughter.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Their slain will also be cast out,<br/>and the stench of their dead bodies will come up.<br/>The mountains will melt in their blood.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>All of the army of the sky will be dissolved.<br/>The sky will be rolled up like a scroll,<br/>and all its armies will fade away,<br/>as a leaf fades from off a vine or a fig tree.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>For my sword has drunk its fill in the sky.<br/>Behold, it will come down on Edom,<br/>and on the people of my curse, for judgment.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>The LORD’s sword is filled with blood.<br/>It is covered with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats,<br/>with the fat of the kidneys of rams;<br/>for the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah,<br/>and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>The wild oxen will come down with them,<br/>and the young bulls with the mighty bulls;<br/>and their land will be drunken with blood,<br/>and their dust made greasy with fat.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>For the LORD has a day of vengeance,<br/>a year of recompense for the cause of Zion.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Its streams will be turned into pitch,<br/>its dust into sulfur,<br/>and its land will become burning pitch.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>It won’t be quenched night or day.<br/>Its smoke will go up forever.<br/>From generation to generation, it will lie waste.<br/>No one will pass through it forever and ever.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>But the pelican and the porcupine will possess it.<br/>The owl and the raven will dwell in it.<br/>He will stretch the line of confusion over it,<br/>and the plumb line of emptiness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>They shall call its nobles to the kingdom, but none shall be there;<br/>and all its princes shall be nothing.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Thorns will come up in its palaces,<br/>nettles and thistles in its fortresses;<br/>and it will be a habitation of jackals,<br/>a court for ostriches.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>The wild animals of the desert will meet with the wolves,<br/>and the wild goat will cry to his fellow.<br/>Yes, the night creature<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="isa-34-14-note-1">
