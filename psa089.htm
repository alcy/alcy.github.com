    <h1>Psalm 89</h1>

    <p class="psalm-subtitle">A contemplation by Ethan, the Ezrahite.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>I will sing of the loving kindness of the LORD forever.<br/>With my mouth, I will make known your faithfulness to all generations.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>I indeed declare, “Love stands firm forever.<br/>You established the heavens.<br/>Your faithfulness is in them.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>“I have made a covenant with my chosen one,<br/>I have sworn to David, my servant,<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>‘I will establish your offspring forever,<br/>and build up your throne to all generations.’ ”<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>The heavens will praise your wonders, LORD,<br/>your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>For who in the skies can be compared to the LORD?<br/>Who among the sons of the heavenly beings is like the LORD,<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>a very awesome God in the council of the holy ones,<br/>to be feared above all those who are around him?<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>LORD,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="psa-89-8-note-1">

            </span> your faithfulness is around you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>You rule the pride of the sea.<br/>When its waves rise up, you calm them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>You have broken Rahab in pieces, like one of the slain.<br/>You have scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>The heavens are yours.<br/>The earth also is yours,<br/>the world and its fullness.<br/>You have founded them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>You have created the north and the south.<br/>Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>You have a mighty arm.<br/>Your hand is strong, and your right hand is exalted.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne.<br/>Loving kindness and truth go before your face.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Blessed are the people who learn to acclaim you.<br/>They walk in the light of your presence, LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>In your name they rejoice all day.<br/>In your righteousness, they are exalted.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>For you are the glory of their strength.<br/>In your favor, our horn will be exalted.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>For our shield belongs to the LORD,<br/>our king to the Holy One of Israel.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Then you spoke in vision to your saints,<br/>and said, “I have given strength to the warrior.<br/>I have exalted a young man from the people.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>I have found David, my servant.<br/>I have anointed him with my holy oil,<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>with whom my hand shall be established.<br/>My arm will also strengthen him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>No enemy will tax him.<br/>No wicked man will oppress him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>I will beat down his adversaries before him,<br/>and strike those who hate him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>But my faithfulness and my loving kindness will be with him.<br/>In my name, his horn will be exalted.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>I will set his hand also on the sea,<br/>and his right hand on the rivers.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>He will call to me, ‘You are my Father,<br/>my God, and the rock of my salvation!’<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>I will also appoint him my firstborn,<br/>the highest of the kings of the earth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>I will keep my loving kindness for him forever more.<br/>My covenant will stand firm with him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>I will also make his offspring endure forever,<br/>and his throne as the days of heaven.<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>If his children forsake my law,<br/>and don’t walk in my ordinances;<br/><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>if they break my statutes,<br/>and don’t keep my commandments;<br/><span class="verse" id="V32"></span>then I will punish their sin with the rod,<br/>and their iniquity with stripes.<br/><span class="verse" id="V33"></span>But I will not completely take my loving kindness from him,<br/>nor allow my faithfulness to fail.<br/><span class="verse" id="V34"></span>I will not break my covenant,<br/>nor alter what my lips have uttered.<br/><span class="verse" id="V35"></span>Once I have sworn by my holiness,<br/>I will not lie to David.<br/><span class="verse" id="V36"></span>His offspring will endure forever,<br/>his throne like the sun before me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V37"></span>It will be established forever like the moon,<br/>the faithful witness in the sky.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V38"></span>But you have rejected and spurned.<br/>You have been angry with your anointed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V39"></span>You have renounced the covenant of your servant.<br/>You have defiled his crown in the dust.<br/><span class="verse" id="V40"></span>You have broken down all his hedges.<br/>You have brought his strongholds to ruin.<br/><span class="verse" id="V41"></span>All who pass by the way rob him.<br/>He has become a reproach to his neighbors.<br/><span class="verse" id="V42"></span>You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries.<br/>You have made all of his enemies rejoice.<br/><span class="verse" id="V43"></span>Yes, you turn back the edge of his sword,<br/>and haven’t supported him in battle.<br/><span class="verse" id="V44"></span>You have ended his splendor,<br/>and thrown his throne down to the ground.<br/><span class="verse" id="V45"></span>You have shortened the days of his youth.<br/>You have covered him with shame.<br/><span class="verse" id="V46"></span>How long, LORD?<br/>Will you hide yourself forever?<br/>Will your wrath burn like fire?<br/><span class="verse" id="V47"></span>Remember how short my time is,<br/>for what vanity you have created all the children of men!<br/><span class="verse" id="V48"></span>What man is he who shall live and not see death,<br/>who shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol?<label class="margin-toggle
