    <h1>The Proverbs</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 18</h2>
    
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>A man who isolates himself pursues selfishness,<br/>and defies all sound judgment.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>A fool has no delight in understanding,<br/>but only in revealing his own opinion.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>When wickedness comes, contempt also comes,<br/>and with shame comes disgrace.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>The words of a man’s mouth are like deep waters.<br/>The fountain of wisdom is like a flowing brook.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>To be partial to the faces of the wicked is not good,<br/>nor to deprive the innocent of justice.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>A fool’s lips come into strife,<br/>and his mouth invites beatings.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>A fool’s mouth is his destruction,<br/>and his lips are a snare to his soul.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>The words of a gossip are like dainty morsels:<br/>they go down into a person’s innermost parts.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>One who is slack in his work<br/>is brother to him who is a master of destruction.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>The LORD’s name is a strong tower:<br/>the righteous run to him, and are safe.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>The rich man’s wealth is his strong city,<br/>like an unscalable wall in his own imagination.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Before destruction the heart of man is proud,<br/>but before honor is humility.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>He who answers before he hears,<br/>that is folly and shame to him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>A man’s spirit will sustain him in sickness,<br/>but a crushed spirit, who can bear?<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>The heart of the discerning gets knowledge.<br/>The ear of the wise seeks knowledge.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>A man’s gift makes room for him,<br/>and brings him before great men.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>He who pleads his cause first seems right—<br/>until another comes and questions him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>The lot settles disputes,<br/>and keeps strong ones apart.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>A brother offended is more difficult than a fortified city.<br/>Disputes are like the bars of a fortress.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>A man’s stomach is filled with the fruit of his mouth.<br/>With the harvest of his lips he is satisfied.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Death and life are in the power of the tongue;<br/>those who love it will eat its fruit.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Whoever finds a wife finds a good thing,<br/>and obtains favor of the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>The poor plead for mercy,<br/>but the rich answer harshly.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>A man of many companions may be ruined,<br/>but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.</p></blockquote></section>
