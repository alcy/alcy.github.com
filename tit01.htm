        “Christ” means “Anointed One”.
        </span> according to the faith of God’s chosen ones and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>in hope of eternal life, which God, who can’t lie, promised before time began;   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior,   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you—   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>For the overseer must be blameless, as God’s steward, not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain;   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober minded, fair, holy, self-controlled,   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>whose mouths must be stopped: men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain’s sake.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons.”   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>This testimony is true. For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>They profess that they know God, but by their deeds they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="tit02.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
