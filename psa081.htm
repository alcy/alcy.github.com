    <p class="psalm-subtitle">For the Chief Musician. On an instrument of Gath. By Asaph.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Sing aloud to God, our strength!<br/>Make a joyful shout to the God of Jacob!<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Raise a song, and bring here the tambourine,<br/>the pleasant lyre with the harp.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Blow the trumpet at the New Moon,<br/>at the full moon, on our feast day.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>For it is a statute for Israel,<br/>an ordinance of the God of Jacob.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>He appointed it in Joseph for a covenant,<br/>when he went out over the land of Egypt,<br/>I heard a language that I didn’t know.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>“I removed his shoulder from the burden.<br/>His hands were freed from the basket.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>You called in trouble, and I delivered you.<br/>I answered you in the secret place of thunder.<br/>I tested you at the waters of Meribah.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>“Hear, my people, and I will testify to you,<br/>Israel, if you would listen to me!<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>There shall be no strange god in you,<br/>neither shall you worship any foreign god.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>I am the LORD, your God,<br/>who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.<br/>Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>But my people didn’t listen to my voice.<br/>Israel desired none of me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>So I let them go after the stubbornness of their hearts,<br/>that they might walk in their own counsels.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Oh that my people would listen to me,<br/>that Israel would walk in my ways!<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>I would soon subdue their enemies,<br/>and turn my hand against their adversaries.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>The haters of the LORD would cringe before him,<br/>and their punishment would last forever.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>But he would have also fed them with the finest of the wheat.<br/>I will satisfy you with honey out of the rock.” <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="psa082.htm">→</a></span></p></blockquote></section>
