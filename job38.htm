    <h2>Chapter 38</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind,</p><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>“Who is this who darkens counsel<br/>by words without knowledge?<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Brace yourself like a man,<br/>for I will question you, then you answer me!<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>“Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?<br/>Declare, if you have understanding.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Who determined its measures, if you know?<br/>Or who stretched the line on it?<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>What were its foundations fastened on?<br/>Or who laid its cornerstone,<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>when the morning stars sang together,<br/>and all the sons of God shouted for joy?<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>“Or who shut up the sea with doors,<br/>when it broke out of the womb,<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>when I made clouds its garment,<br/>and wrapped it in thick darkness,<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>marked out for it my bound,<br/>set bars and doors,<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>and said, ‘You may come here, but no further.<br/>Your proud waves shall be stopped here’?<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>“Have you commanded the morning in your days,<br/>and caused the dawn to know its place,<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>that it might take hold of the ends of the earth,<br/>and shake the wicked out of it?<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>It is changed as clay under the seal,<br/>and presented as a garment.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>From the wicked, their light is withheld.<br/>The high arm is broken.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>“Have you entered into the springs of the sea?<br/>Or have you walked in the recesses of the deep?<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Have the gates of death been revealed to you?<br/>Or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Have you comprehended the earth in its width?<br/>Declare, if you know it all.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>“What is the way to the dwelling of light?<br/>As for darkness, where is its place,<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>that you should take it to its bound,<br/>that you should discern the paths to its house?<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Surely you know, for you were born then,<br/>and the number of your days is great!<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Have you entered the storehouses of the snow,<br/>or have you seen the storehouses of the hail,<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>which I have reserved against the time of trouble,<br/>against the day of battle and war?<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>By what way is the lightning distributed,<br/>or the east wind scattered on the earth?<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>Who has cut a channel for the flood water,<br/>or the path for the thunderstorm,<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>to cause it to rain on a land where there is no man,<br/>on the wilderness, in which there is no man,<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>to satisfy the waste and desolate ground,<br/>to cause the tender grass to grow?<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>Does the rain have a father?<br/>Or who fathers the drops of dew?<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>Whose womb did the ice come out of?<br/>Who has given birth to the gray frost of the sky?<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>The waters become hard like stone,<br/>when the surface of the deep is frozen.<br/><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>“Can you bind the cluster of the Pleiades,<br/>or loosen the cords of Orion?<br/><span class="verse" id="V32"></span>Can you lead the constellations out in their season?<br/>Or can you guide the Bear with her cubs?<br/><span class="verse" id="V33"></span>Do you know the laws of the heavens?<br/>Can you establish its dominion over the earth?<br/><span class="verse" id="V34"></span>“Can you lift up your voice to the clouds,<br/>that abundance of waters may cover you?<br/><span class="verse" id="V35"></span>Can you send out lightnings, that they may go?<br/>Do they report to you, ‘Here we are’?<br/><span class="verse" id="V36"></span>Who has put wisdom in the inward parts?<br/>Or who has given understanding to the mind?<br/><span class="verse" id="V37"></span>Who can count the clouds by wisdom?<br/>Or who can pour out the containers of the sky,<br/><span class="verse" id="V38"></span>when the dust runs into a mass,<br/>and the clods of earth stick together?<br/><span class="verse" id="V39"></span>“Can you hunt the prey for the lioness,<br/>or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,<br/><span class="verse" id="V40"></span>when they crouch in their dens,<br/>and lie in wait in the thicket?<br/><span class="verse" id="V41"></span>Who provides for the raven his prey,<br/>when his young ones cry to God,<br/>and wander for lack of food?</p></blockquote></section>
