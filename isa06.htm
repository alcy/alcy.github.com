    <h1>Isaiah</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Above him stood the seraphim. Each one had six wings. With two he covered his face. With two he covered his feet. With two he flew.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>One called to another, and said,</p><blockquote><p>“Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of Armies!<br/>The whole earth is full of his glory!”</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Then I said, “Woe is me! For I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips and I live among a people of unclean lips, for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of Armies!”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>He touched my mouth with it, and said, “Behold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin forgiven.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>I heard the Lord’s voice, saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?”</p><p>Then I said, “Here I am. Send me!”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>He said, “Go, and tell this people,</p><blockquote><p>‘You hear indeed,<br/>but don’t understand.<br/>You see indeed,<br/>but don’t perceive.’<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Make the heart of this people fat.<br/>Make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes;<br/>lest they see with their eyes,<br/>hear with their ears,<br/>understand with their heart,<br/>and turn again, and be healed.”</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Then I said, “Lord, how long?”</p><p>He answered,</p><blockquote><p>“Until cities are waste without inhabitant,<br/>houses without man,<br/>the land becomes utterly waste,<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>and the LORD has removed men far away,<br/>and the forsaken places are many within the land.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>If there is a tenth left in it,<br/>that also will in turn be consumed,<br/>as a terebinth, and as an oak whose stump remains when they are cut down,<br/>so the holy seed is its stump.”</p></blockquote></section>
