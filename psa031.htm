    <p class="psalm-subtitle">For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>In you, LORD, I take refuge.<br/>Let me never be disappointed.<br/>Deliver me in your righteousness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Bow down your ear to me.<br/>Deliver me speedily.<br/>Be to me a strong rock,<br/>a house of defense to save me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For you are my rock and my fortress,<br/>therefore for your name’s sake lead me and guide me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Pluck me out of the net that they have laid secretly for me,<br/>for you are my stronghold.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Into your hand I commend my spirit.<br/>You redeem me, LORD, God of truth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>I hate those who regard lying vanities,<br/>but I trust in the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>I will be glad and rejoice in your loving kindness,<br/>for you have seen my affliction.<br/>You have known my soul in adversities.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>You have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy.<br/>You have set my feet in a large place.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Have mercy on me, LORD, for I am in distress.<br/>My eye, my soul, and my body waste away with grief.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>For my life is spent with sorrow,<br/>my years with sighing.<br/>My strength fails because of my iniquity.<br/>My bones are wasted away.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Because of all my adversaries I have become utterly contemptible to my neighbors,<br/>a horror to my acquaintances.<br/>Those who saw me on the street fled from me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>I am forgotten from their hearts like a dead man.<br/>I am like broken pottery.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>For I have heard the slander of many, terror on every side,<br/>while they conspire together against me,<br/>they plot to take away my life.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>But I trust in you, LORD.<br/>I said, “You are my God.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>My times are in your hand.<br/>Deliver me from the hand of my enemies, and from those who persecute me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Make your face to shine on your servant.<br/>Save me in your loving kindness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Let me not be disappointed, LORD, for I have called on you.<br/>Let the wicked be disappointed.<br/>Let them be silent in Sheol.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="psa-31-17-note-1">

            Sheol is the place of the dead.
