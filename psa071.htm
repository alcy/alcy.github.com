    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>In you, LORD, I take refuge.<br/>Never let me be disappointed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Deliver me in your righteousness, and rescue me.<br/>Turn your ear to me, and save me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Be to me a rock of refuge to which I may always go.<br/>Give the command to save me,<br/>for you are my rock and my fortress.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Rescue me, my God, from the hand of the wicked,<br/>from the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>For you are my hope, Lord GOD,<br/>my confidence from my youth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>I have relied on you from the womb.<br/>You are he who took me out of my mother’s womb.<br/>I will always praise you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>I am a marvel to many,<br/>but you are my strong refuge.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>My mouth shall be filled with your praise,<br/>with your honor all day long.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Don’t reject me in my old age.<br/>Don’t forsake me when my strength fails.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>For my enemies talk about me.<br/>Those who watch for my soul conspire together,<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>saying, “God has forsaken him.<br/>Pursue and take him, for no one will rescue him.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>God, don’t be far from me.<br/>My God, hurry to help me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Let my accusers be disappointed and consumed.<br/>Let them be covered with disgrace and scorn who want to harm me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>But I will always hope,<br/>and will add to all of your praise.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>My mouth will tell about your righteousness,<br/>and of your salvation all day,<br/>though I don’t know its full measure.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord GOD.<br/>I will make mention of your righteousness, even of yours alone.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>God, you have taught me from my youth.<br/>Until now, I have declared your wondrous works.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Yes, even when I am old and gray-haired, God, don’t forsake me,<br/>until I have declared your strength to the next generation,<br/>your might to everyone who is to come.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>God, your righteousness also reaches to the heavens.<br/>You have done great things.<br/>God, who is like you?<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>You, who have shown us many and bitter troubles,<br/>you will let me live.<br/>You will bring us up again from the depths of the earth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Increase my honor<br/>and comfort me again.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, my God.<br/>I sing praises to you with the lyre, Holy One of Israel.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>My lips shall shout for joy!<br/>My soul, which you have redeemed, sings praises to you!<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>My tongue will also talk about your righteousness all day long,<br/>for they are disappointed, and they are confounded,<br/>who want to harm me. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="psa072.htm">→</a></span></p></blockquote></section>
