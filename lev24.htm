    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>“Command the children of Israel, that they bring to you pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Outside of the veil of the Testimony, in the Tent of Meeting, Aaron shall keep it in order from evening to morning before the LORD continually. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>He shall keep in order the lamps on the pure gold lamp stand before the LORD continually.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>“You shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes of it: two tenths of an ephah<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="lev-24-5-note-1">

        1 ephah is about 22 liters or about 2/3 of a bushel
        </span> shall be in one cake.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>You shall set them in two rows, six on a row, on the pure gold table before the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>You shall put pure frankincense on each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire to the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Every Sabbath day he shall set it in order before the LORD continually. It is an everlasting covenant on the behalf of the children of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>It shall be for Aaron and his sons. They shall eat it in a holy place; for it is most holy to him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>The son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and the son of the Israelite woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed; and they brought him to Moses. His mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>They put him in custody until the LORD’s will should be declared to them.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>“Bring him who cursed out of the camp; and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head, and let all the congregation stone him.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>He who blasphemes the LORD’s name, he shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall certainly stone him. The foreigner as well as the native-born shall be put to death when he blasphemes the Name.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>“ ‘He who strikes any man mortally shall surely be put to death.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>He who strikes an animal mortally shall make it good, life for life.   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>If anyone injures his neighbor, it shall be done to him as he has done:   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. It shall be done to him as he has injured someone.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>He who kills an animal shall make it good; and he who kills a man shall be put to death.   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>You shall have one kind of law for the foreigner as well as the native-born; for I am the LORD your God.’ ”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and they brought him who had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones. The children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.</p></section>
