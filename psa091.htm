    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High<br/>will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>I will say of the LORD, “He is my refuge and my fortress;<br/>my God, in whom I trust.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler,<br/>and from the deadly pestilence.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>He will cover you with his feathers.<br/>Under his wings you will take refuge.<br/>His faithfulness is your shield and rampart.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>You shall not be afraid of the terror by night,<br/>nor of the arrow that flies by day,<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness,<br/>nor of the destruction that wastes at noonday.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>A thousand may fall at your side,<br/>and ten thousand at your right hand;<br/>but it will not come near you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>You will only look with your eyes,<br/>and see the recompense of the wicked.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Because you have made the LORD your refuge,<br/>and the Most High your dwelling place,<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>no evil shall happen to you,<br/>neither shall any plague come near your dwelling.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>For he will put his angels in charge of you,<br/>to guard you in all your ways.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>They will bear you up in their hands,<br/>so that you won’t dash your foot against a stone.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>You will tread on the lion and cobra.<br/>You will trample the young lion and the serpent underfoot.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>“Because he has set his love on me, therefore I will deliver him.<br/>I will set him on high, because he has known my name.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>He will call on me, and I will answer him.<br/>I will be with him in trouble.<br/>I will deliver him, and honor him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>I will satisfy him with long life,<br/>and show him my salvation.”</p></blockquote></section>
