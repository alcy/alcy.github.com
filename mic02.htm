    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Woe to those who devise iniquity<br/>and work evil on their beds!<br/>When the morning is light, they practice it,<br/>because it is in the power of their hand.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>They covet fields and seize them,<br/>and houses, then take them away.<br/>They oppress a man and his house,<br/>even a man and his heritage.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Therefore the LORD says:<br/>“Behold, I am planning against these people a disaster,<br/>from which you will not remove your necks,<br/>neither will you walk haughtily,<br/>for it is an evil time.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>In that day they will take up a parable against you,<br/>and lament with a doleful lamentation, saying,<br/>‘We are utterly ruined!<br/>My people’s possession is divided up.<br/>Indeed he takes it from me and assigns our fields to traitors!’ ”<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Therefore you will have no one who divides the land by lot in the LORD’s assembly.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>“Don’t prophesy!”—they prophesy—<br/>“Don’t prophesy about these things.<br/>Disgrace won’t overtake us.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Shall it be said, O house of Jacob,<br/>“Is the LORD’s Spirit angry?<br/>Are these his doings?<br/>Don’t my words do good to him who walks blamelessly?”<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>But lately my people have risen up as an enemy.<br/>You strip the robe and clothing from those who pass by without a care, returning from battle.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>You drive the women of my people out from their pleasant houses;<br/>from their young children you take away my blessing forever.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Arise, and depart!<br/>For this is not your resting place,<br/>because of uncleanness that destroys,<br/>even with a grievous destruction.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood lies, saying,<br/>“I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong drink,”<br/>he would be the prophet of this people.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>I will surely assemble all of you, Jacob.<br/>I will surely gather the remnant of Israel.<br/>I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah,<br/>as a flock in the middle of their pasture.<br/>They will swarm with people.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>He who breaks open the way goes up before them.<br/>They break through the gate, and go out.<br/>Their king passes on before them,<br/>with the LORD at their head.</p></blockquote></section>
