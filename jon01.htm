        When rendered in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS, “LORD” or “GOD” is the translation of God’s Proper Name (Hebrew “יהוה”, usually pronounced Yahweh).

He went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish; so he paid its fare, and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>But the LORD sent out a great wind on the sea, and there was a mighty storm on the sea, so that the ship was likely to break up.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Then the mariners were afraid, and every man cried to his god. They threw the cargo that was in the ship into the sea to lighten the ship. But Jonah had gone down into the innermost parts of the ship and he was laying down, and was fast asleep.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>So the ship master came to him, and said to him, “What do you mean, sleeper?

Let’s cast lots, that we may know who is responsible for this evil that is on us.” So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Then they asked him, “Tell us, please, for whose cause this evil is on us. What is your occupation? Where do you come from? What is your country? Of what people are you?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>He said to them, “I am a Hebrew, and I fear the LORD, the God<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="jon-1-9-note-1">
