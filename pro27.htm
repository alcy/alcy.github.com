    <h1>The Proverbs</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 27</h2>
    
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Don’t boast about tomorrow;<br/>for you don’t know what a day may bring.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Let another man praise you,<br/>and not your own mouth;<br/>a stranger, and not your own lips.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>A stone is heavy,<br/>and sand is a burden;<br/>but a fool’s provocation is heavier than both.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Wrath is cruel,<br/>and anger is overwhelming;<br/>but who is able to stand before jealousy?<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Better is open rebuke<br/>than hidden love.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>The wounds of a friend are faithful,<br/>although the kisses of an enemy are profuse.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>A full soul loathes a honeycomb;<br/>but to a hungry soul, every bitter thing is sweet.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>As a bird that wanders from her nest,<br/>so is a man who wanders from his home.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart;<br/>so does earnest counsel from a man’s friend.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Don’t forsake your friend and your father’s friend.<br/>Don’t go to your brother’s house in the day of your disaster.<br/>A neighbor who is near is better than a distant brother.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Be wise, my son,<br/>and bring joy to my heart,<br/>then I can answer my tormentor.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge;<br/>but the simple pass on, and suffer for it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Take his garment when he puts up collateral for a stranger.<br/>Hold it for a wayward woman!<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning,<br/>it will be taken as a curse by him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>A continual dropping on a rainy day<br/>and a contentious wife are alike:<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>restraining her is like restraining the wind,<br/>or like grasping oil in his right hand.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Iron sharpens iron;<br/>so a man sharpens his friend’s countenance.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Whoever tends the fig tree shall eat its fruit.<br/>He who looks after his master shall be honored.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Like water reflects a face,<br/>so a man’s heart reflects the man.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Sheol<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="pro-27-20-note-1">
</label>
<input class="margin-toggle" id="pro-27-20-note-1" type="checkbox"/>
<span class="sidenote">
            Sheol is the place of the dead.
            </span> and Abaddon are never satisfied;<br/>and a man’s eyes are never satisfied.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>The crucible is for silver,<br/>and the furnace for gold;<br/>but man is refined by his praise.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with grain,<br/>yet his foolishness will not be removed from him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Know well the state of your flocks,<br/>and pay attention to your herds,<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>for riches are not forever,<br/>nor does the crown endure to all generations.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>The hay is removed, and the new growth appears,<br/>the grasses of the hills are gathered in.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>The lambs are for your clothing,<br/>and the goats are the price of a field.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>There will be plenty of goats’ milk for your food,<br/>for your family’s food,<br/>and for the nourishment of your servant girls.</p></blockquote></section>
