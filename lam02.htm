    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>How has the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger!</p><blockquote><p>He has cast the beauty of Israel down from heaven to the earth,<br/>and hasn’t remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>The Lord has swallowed up all the dwellings of Jacob<br/>without pity.<br/>He has thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah.<br/>He has brought them down to the ground.<br/>He has profaned the kingdom and its princes.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>He has cut off all the horn of Israel in fierce anger.<br/>He has drawn back his right hand from before the enemy.<br/>He has burned up Jacob like a flaming fire,<br/>which devours all around.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>He has bent his bow like an enemy.<br/>He has stood with his right hand as an adversary.<br/>He has killed all that were pleasant to the eye.<br/>In the tent of the daughter of Zion, he has poured out his wrath like fire.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>The Lord has become as an enemy.<br/>He has swallowed up Israel.<br/>He has swallowed up all her palaces.<br/>He has destroyed his strongholds.<br/>He has multiplied mourning and lamentation in the daughter of Judah.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>He has violently taken away his tabernacle,<br/>as if it were a garden.<br/>He has destroyed his place of assembly.<br/>The LORD has caused solemn assembly and Sabbath to be forgotten in Zion.<br/>In the indignation of his anger, he has despised the king and the priest.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>The Lord has cast off his altar.<br/>He has abhorred his sanctuary.<br/>He has given the walls of her palaces into the hand of the enemy.<br/>They have made a noise in the LORD’s house,<br/>as in the day of a solemn assembly.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>The LORD has purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion.<br/>He has stretched out the line.<br/>He has not withdrawn his hand from destroying;<br/>He has made the rampart and wall lament.<br/>They languish together.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Her gates have sunk into the ground.<br/>He has destroyed and broken her bars.<br/>Her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not.<br/>Yes, her prophets find no vision from the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>The elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground.<br/>They keep silence.<br/>They have cast up dust on their heads.<br/>They have clothed themselves with sackcloth.<br/>The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>My eyes fail with tears.<br/>My heart is troubled.<br/>My bile is poured on the earth,<br/>because of the destruction of the daughter of my people,<br/>because the young children and the infants swoon in the streets of the city.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>They ask their mothers,<br/>“Where is grain and wine?”<br/>when they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city,<br/>when their soul is poured out into their mothers’ bosom.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>What shall I testify to you?<br/>What shall I liken to you, daughter of Jerusalem?<br/>What shall I compare to you,<br/>that I may comfort you, virgin daughter of Zion?<br/>For your breach is as big as the sea.<br/>Who can heal you?<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Your prophets have seen false and foolish visions for you.<br/>They have not uncovered your iniquity,<br/>to reverse your captivity,<br/>but have seen for you false revelations and causes of banishment.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>All that pass by clap their hands at you.<br/>They hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying,<br/>“Is this the city that men called ‘The perfection of beauty,<br/>the joy of the whole earth’?”<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>All your enemies have opened their mouth wide against you.<br/>They hiss and gnash their teeth.<br/>They say, “We have swallowed her up.<br/>Certainly this is the day that we looked for.<br/>We have found it.<br/>We have seen it.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>The LORD has done that which he planned.<br/>He has fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old.<br/>He has thrown down,<br/>and has not pitied.<br/>He has caused the enemy to rejoice over you.<br/>He has exalted the horn of your adversaries.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Their heart cried to the Lord.<br/>O wall of the daughter of Zion,<br/>let tears run down like a river day and night.<br/>Give yourself no relief.<br/>Don’t let your eyes rest.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Arise, cry out in the night,<br/>at the beginning of the watches!<br/>Pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord.<br/>Lift up your hands toward him for the life of your young children,<br/>who faint for hunger at the head of every street.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>“Look, LORD, and see to whom you have done thus!<br/>Should the women eat their offspring,<br/>the children that they held and bounced on their knees?<br/>Should the priest and the prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>“The youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets.<br/>My virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword.<br/>You have killed them in the day of your anger.<br/>You have slaughtered, and not pitied.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>“You have called, as in the day of a solemn assembly, my terrors on every side.<br/>There was no one that escaped or remained in the day of the LORD’s anger.<br/>My enemy has consumed those whom I have cared for and brought up.</p></blockquote></section>
