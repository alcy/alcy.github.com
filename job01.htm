For Job said, “It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts.” Job did so continually.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Now on the day when God’s sons came to present themselves before the LORD,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="job-1-6-note-1">

        When rendered in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS, “LORD” or “GOD” is the translation of God’s Proper Name (Hebrew “יהוה”, usually pronounced Yahweh).
        </span> Satan also came among them.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>The LORD said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”</p><p>Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, “From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>The LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant, Job? For there is no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing?   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Haven’t you made a hedge around him, and around his house, and around all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>But stretch out your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will renounce you to your face.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>The LORD said to Satan, “Behold,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="job-1-12-note-1">

        “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.
        </span> all that he has is in your power. Only on himself don’t stretch out your hand.”</p><p>So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>It fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>that a messenger came to Job, and said, “The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys feeding beside them,   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>and the Sabeans attacked, and took them away. Yes, they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The fire of God has fallen from the sky, and has burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The Chaldeans made three bands, and swept down on the camels, and have taken them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>and behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead. I alone have escaped to tell you.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Then Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshiped.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>He said, “Naked I came out of my mother’s womb, and naked will I return there. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away. Blessed be the LORD’s name.”   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>In all this, Job didn’t sin, nor charge God with wrongdoing.</p></section>
