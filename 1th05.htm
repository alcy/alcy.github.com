    <h1>Paul's First Letter to the Thessalonians</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything be written to you.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For when they are saying, “Peace and safety,” then sudden destruction will come on them, like birth pains on a pregnant woman. Then they will in no way escape.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>But you, brothers, aren’t in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>You are all children of light and children of the day. We don’t belong to the night, nor to darkness,   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>so then let’s not sleep, as the rest do, but let’s watch and be sober.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>For those who sleep, sleep in the night; and those who are drunk are drunk in the night.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>But since we belong to the day, let’s be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>For God didn’t appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Therefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as you also do.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>But we beg you, brothers, to know those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord and admonish you,   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>and to respect and honor them in love for their work’s sake.</p><p>Be at peace among yourselves.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>We exhort you, brothers: Admonish the disorderly; encourage the faint-hearted; support the weak; be patient toward all.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>See that no one returns evil for evil to anyone, but always follow after that which is good for one another and for all.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Always rejoice.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Pray without ceasing.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you.   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Don’t quench the Spirit.   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Don’t despise prophecies.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Test all things, and hold firmly that which is good.   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Abstain from every form of evil.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely. May your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>He who calls you is faithful, who will also do it.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>Brothers, pray for us.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.   <span class="verse" id="V27"></span>I solemnly command you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.</p></section>
