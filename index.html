    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>God, having in the past spoken to the fathers through
            the prophets at many times and in various ways, <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>has at the end of
            these days spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the
            worlds. <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>His Son is the radiance of his glory, the very image of
            his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, who, when he had by himself purified us of
            our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high, <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>having become as much better than the angels as the more excellent name he has
            inherited is better than theirs. <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>For to which of the angels did he
            say at any time,</p><blockquote><p>“You are my Son.<br/>Today I have become your father?”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="heb-1-5-note-1">
