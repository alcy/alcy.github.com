    <h2>Chapter 31</h2>
    
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help,<br/>and rely on horses,<br/>and trust in chariots because they are many,<br/>and in horsemen because they are very strong,<br/>but they don’t look to the Holy One of Israel,<br/>and they don’t seek the LORD!<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Yet he also is wise, and will bring disaster,<br/>and will not call back his words, but will arise against the house of the evildoers,<br/>and against the help of those who work iniquity.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Now the Egyptians are men, and not God;<br/>and their horses flesh, and not spirit.<br/>When the LORD stretches out his hand, both he who helps shall stumble,<br/>and he who is helped shall fall,<br/>and they all shall be consumed together.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>For the LORD says to me,<br/>“As the lion and the young lion growling over his prey,<br/>if a multitude of shepherds is called together against him,<br/>will not be dismayed at their voice,<br/>nor abase himself for their noise,<br/>so the LORD of Armies will come down to fight on Mount Zion and on its heights.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>As birds hovering, so the LORD of Armies will protect Jerusalem.<br/>He will protect and deliver it.<br/>He will pass over and preserve it.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Return to him from whom you have deeply revolted, children of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>For in that day everyone shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold—sin which your own hands have made for you.</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>“The Assyrian will fall by the sword, not of man;</p><blockquote><p>and the sword, not of mankind, shall devour him.<br/>He will flee from the sword,<br/>and his young men will become subject to forced labor.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>His rock will pass away by reason of terror,<br/>and his princes will be afraid of the banner,”<br/>says the LORD, whose fire is in Zion,<br/>and his furnace in Jerusalem.</p></blockquote></section>
