Why have you come?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>They said, “Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man and one who fears God, and well spoken of by all the nation of the Jews, was directed by a holy angel to invite you to his house, and to listen to what you say.”   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>So he called them in and provided a place to stay.</p><p>On the next day Peter arose and went out with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>On the next day they entered into Caesarea.
