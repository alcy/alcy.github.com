    <p class="psalm-subtitle">For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>I waited patiently for the LORD.<br/>He turned to me, and heard my cry.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>He brought me up also out of a horrible pit,<br/>out of the miry clay.<br/>He set my feet on a rock,<br/>and gave me a firm place to stand.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>He has put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God.<br/>Many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Blessed is the man who makes the LORD his trust,<br/>and doesn’t respect the proud, nor such as turn away to lies.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Many, LORD, my God, are the wonderful works which you have done,<br/>and your thoughts which are toward us.<br/>They can’t be declared back to you.<br/>If I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be counted.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Sacrifice and offering you didn’t desire.<br/>You have opened my ears.<br/>You have not required burnt offering and sin offering.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Then I said, “Behold, I have come.<br/>It is written about me in the book in the scroll.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>I delight to do your will, my God.<br/>Yes, your law is within my heart.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>I have proclaimed glad news of righteousness in the great assembly.<br/>Behold, I will not seal my lips, LORD, you know.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>I have not hidden your righteousness within my heart.<br/>I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation.<br/>I have not concealed your loving kindness and your truth from the great assembly.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Don’t withhold your tender mercies from me, LORD.<br/>Let your loving kindness and your truth continually preserve me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>For innumerable evils have surrounded me.<br/>My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up.<br/>They are more than the hairs of my head.<br/>My heart has failed me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Be pleased, LORD, to deliver me.<br/>Hurry to help me, LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Let them be disappointed and confounded together who seek after my soul to destroy it.<br/>Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Let them be desolate by reason of their shame that tell me, “Aha! Aha!”<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you.<br/>Let such as love your salvation say continually, “Let the LORD be exalted!”<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>But I am poor and needy.<br/>May the Lord think about me.<br/>You are my help and my deliverer.<br/>Don’t delay, my God.</p></blockquote></section>
