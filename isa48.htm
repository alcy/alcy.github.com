    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>“Hear this, house of Jacob,<br/>you who are called by the name of Israel,<br/>and have come out of the waters of Judah.<br/>You swear by the LORD’s name,<br/>and make mention of the God of Israel,<br/>but not in truth, nor in righteousness—<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>for they call themselves citizens of the holy city,<br/>and rely on the God of Israel;<br/>the LORD of Armies is his name.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>I have declared the former things from of old.<br/>Yes, they went out of my mouth, and I revealed them.<br/>I did them suddenly, and they happened.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Because I knew that you are obstinate,<br/>and your neck is an iron sinew,<br/>and your brow bronze;<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>therefore I have declared it to you from of old;<br/>before it came to pass I showed it to you;<br/>lest you should say, ‘My idol has done them.<br/>My engraved image and my molten image has commanded them.’<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>You have heard it.<br/>Now see all this.<br/>And you, won’t you declare it?<br/>“I have shown you new things from this time,<br/>even hidden things, which you have not known.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>They are created now, and not from of old.<br/>Before today, you didn’t hear them,<br/>lest you should say, ‘Behold, I knew them.’<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Yes, you didn’t hear.<br/>Yes, you didn’t know.<br/>Yes, from of old your ear was not opened,<br/>for I knew that you dealt very treacherously,<br/>and were called a transgressor from the womb.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>For my name’s sake, I will defer my anger,<br/>and for my praise, I hold it back for you<br/>so that I don’t cut you off.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Behold, I have refined you,<br/>but not as silver.<br/>I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>For my own sake,<br/>for my own sake, I will do it;<br/>for how would my name be profaned?<br/>I will not give my glory to another.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>“Listen to me, O Jacob,<br/>and Israel my called:<br/>I am he.<br/>I am the first.<br/>I am also the last.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Yes, my hand has laid the foundation of the earth,<br/>and my right hand has spread out the heavens.<br/>when I call to them, they stand up together.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>“Assemble yourselves, all of you, and hear!<br/>Who among them has declared these things?<br/>He whom the LORD loves will do what he likes to Babylon,<br/>and his arm will be against the Chaldeans.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>I, even I, have spoken.<br/>Yes, I have called him.<br/>I have brought him<br/>and he shall make his way prosperous.</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>“Come near to me and hear this:</p><blockquote><p>“From the beginning I have not spoken in secret;<br/>from the time that it happened, I was there.”<br/>Now the Lord GOD has sent me<br/>with his Spirit.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>The LORD,<br/>your Redeemer,<br/>the Holy One of Israel, says:<br/>“I am the LORD your God,<br/>who teaches you to profit,<br/>who leads you by the way that you should go.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Oh that you had listened to my commandments!<br/>Then your peace would have been like a river<br/>and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Your offspring also would have been as the sand<br/>and the descendants of your body like its grains.<br/>His name would not be cut off nor destroyed from before me.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Leave Babylon!<br/>Flee from the Chaldeans!<br/>With the sound of joyful shouting announce this,<br/>tell it even to the end of the earth;<br/>say, “The LORD has redeemed his servant Jacob!”<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>They didn’t thirst when he led them through the deserts.<br/>He caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them.<br/>He also split the rock and the waters gushed out.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>“There is no peace”, says the LORD, “for the wicked.”</p></blockquote></section>
