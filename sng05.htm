    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride.<br/>I have gathered my myrrh with my spice;<br/>I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey;<br/>I have drunk my wine with my milk.<br/>Eat, friends!<br/>Drink, yes, drink abundantly, beloved.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>I was asleep, but my heart was awake.<br/>It is the voice of my beloved who knocks:<br/>“Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled;<br/>for my head is filled with dew,<br/>and my hair with the dampness of the night.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>I have taken off my robe. Indeed, must I put it on?<br/>I have washed my feet. Indeed, must I soil them?<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>My beloved thrust his hand in through the latch opening.<br/>My heart pounded for him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>I rose up to open for my beloved.<br/>My hands dripped with myrrh,<br/>my fingers with liquid myrrh,<br/>on the handles of the lock.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>I opened to my beloved;<br/>but my beloved left, and had gone away.<br/>My heart went out when he spoke.<br/>I looked for him, but I didn’t find him.<br/>I called him, but he didn’t answer.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>The watchmen who go about the city found me.<br/>They beat me.<br/>They bruised me.<br/>The keepers of the walls took my cloak away from me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,<br/>If you find my beloved,<br/>that you tell him that I am faint with love.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>How is your beloved better than another beloved,<br/>you fairest among women?<br/>How is your beloved better than another beloved,<br/>that you do so adjure us?<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>My beloved is white and ruddy.<br/>The best among ten thousand.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>His head is like the purest gold.<br/>His hair is bushy, black as a raven.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>His eyes are like doves beside the water brooks,<br/>washed with milk, mounted like jewels.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>His cheeks are like a bed of spices with towers of perfumes.<br/>His lips are like lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>His hands are like rings of gold set with beryl.<br/>His body is like ivory work overlaid with sapphires.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>His legs are like pillars of marble set on sockets of fine gold.<br/>His appearance is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>His mouth is sweetness;<br/>yes, he is altogether lovely.<br/>This is my beloved, and this is my friend,<br/>daughters of Jerusalem.</p></blockquote></section>
