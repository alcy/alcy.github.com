    <p class="psalm-subtitle">For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>LORD, you have searched me,<br/>and you know me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>You know my sitting down and my rising up.<br/>You perceive my thoughts from afar.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>You search out my path and my lying down,<br/>and are acquainted with all my ways.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>For there is not a word on my tongue,<br/>but behold, LORD, you know it altogether.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>You hem me in behind and before.<br/>You laid your hand on me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>This knowledge is beyond me.<br/>It’s lofty.<br/>I can’t attain it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Where could I go from your Spirit?<br/>Or where could I flee from your presence?<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>If I ascend up into heaven, you are there.<br/>If I make my bed in Sheol,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="psa-139-8-note-1">

<input class="margin-toggle" id="psa-139-8-note-1" type="checkbox"/>
<span class="sidenote">
            Sheol is the place of the dead.
            </span> behold, you are there!<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>If I take the wings of the dawn,<br/>and settle in the uttermost parts of the sea,<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>even there your hand will lead me,<br/>and your right hand will hold me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>If I say, “Surely the darkness will overwhelm me.<br/>The light around me will be night,”<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>even the darkness doesn’t hide from you,<br/>but the night shines as the day.<br/>The darkness is like light to you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>For you formed my inmost being.<br/>You knit me together in my mother’s womb.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>I will give thanks to you,<br/>for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.<br/>Your works are wonderful.<br/>My soul knows that very well.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>My frame wasn’t hidden from you,<br/>when I was made in secret,<br/>woven together in the depths of the earth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Your eyes saw my body.<br/>In your book they were all written,<br/>the days that were ordained for me,<br/>when as yet there were none of them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>How precious to me are your thoughts, God!<br/>How vast is their sum!<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>If I would count them, they are more in number than the sand.<br/>When I wake up, I am still with you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>If only you, God, would kill the wicked.<br/>Get away from me, you bloodthirsty men!<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>For they speak against you wickedly.<br/>Your enemies take your name in vain.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>LORD, don’t I hate those who hate you?<br/>Am I not grieved with those who rise up against you?<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>I hate them with perfect hatred.<br/>They have become my enemies.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Search me, God, and know my heart.<br/>Try me, and know my thoughts.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>See if there is any wicked way in me,<br/>and lead me in the everlasting way. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="psa140.htm">→</a></span></p></blockquote></section>
