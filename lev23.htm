Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>In the first day you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no regular work.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>But you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD seven days. In the seventh day is a holy convocation. You shall do no regular work.’ ”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>“Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you have come into the land which I give to you, and shall reap its harvest, then you shall bring the sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>He shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you. On the next day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>On the day when you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb without defect a year old for a burnt offering to the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>The meal offering with it shall be two tenths of an ephah<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="lev-23-13-note-1">

In the ninth day of the month at evening, from evening to evening, you shall keep your Sabbath.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V33"></span>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V34"></span>“Speak to the children of Israel, and say, ‘On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of booths<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="lev-23-34-note-1">
