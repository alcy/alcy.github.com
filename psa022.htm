    <h1>Psalm 22</h1>

    <p class="psalm-subtitle">For the Chief Musician; set to “The Doe of the Morning.” A Psalm by David.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?<br/>Why are you so far from helping me, and from the words of my groaning?<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>My God, I cry in the daytime, but you don’t answer;<br/>in the night season, and am not silent.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>But you are holy,<br/>you who inhabit the praises of Israel.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Our fathers trusted in you.<br/>They trusted, and you delivered them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>They cried to you, and were delivered.<br/>They trusted in you, and were not disappointed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>But I am a worm, and no man;<br/>a reproach of men, and despised by the people.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>All those who see me mock me.<br/>They insult me with their lips. They shake their heads, saying,<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>“He trusts in the LORD.<br/>Let him deliver him.<br/>Let him rescue him, since he delights in him.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>But you brought me out of the womb.<br/>You made me trust while at my mother’s breasts.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>I was thrown on you from my mother’s womb.<br/>You are my God since my mother bore me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Don’t be far from me, for trouble is near.<br/>For there is no one to help.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Many bulls have surrounded me.<br/>Strong bulls of Bashan have encircled me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>They open their mouths wide against me,<br/>lions tearing prey and roaring.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>I am poured out like water.<br/>All my bones are out of joint.<br/>My heart is like wax.<br/>It is melted within me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>My strength is dried up like a potsherd.<br/>My tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth.<br/>You have brought me into the dust of death.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>For dogs have surrounded me.<br/>A company of evildoers have enclosed me.<br/>They have pierced my hands and feet.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="psa-22-16-note-1">

            So Dead Sea Scrolls. Masoretic Text reads, “Like a lion, they pin my hands and feet.”
            </span><br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>I can count all of my bones.<br/>They look and stare at me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>They divide my garments among them.<br/>They cast lots for my clothing.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>But don’t be far off, LORD.<br/>You are my help. Hurry to help me!<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Deliver my soul from the sword,<br/>my precious life from the power of the dog.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Save me from the lion’s mouth!<br/>Yes, you have rescued me from the horns of the wild oxen.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>I will declare your name to my brothers.<br/>Among the assembly, I will praise you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>You who fear the LORD, praise him!<br/>All you descendants of Jacob, glorify him!<br/>Stand in awe of him, all you descendants of Israel!<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>For he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted,<br/>neither has he hidden his face from him;<br/>but when he cried to him, he heard.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>My praise of you comes in the great assembly.<br/>I will pay my vows before those who fear him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>The humble shall eat and be satisfied.<br/>They shall praise the LORD who seek after him.<br/>Let your hearts live forever.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the LORD.<br/>All the relatives of the nations shall worship before you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>For the kingdom is the LORD’s.<br/>He is the ruler over the nations.<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>All the rich ones of the earth shall eat and worship.<br/>All those who go down to the dust shall bow before him,<br/>even he who can’t keep his soul alive.<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>Posterity shall serve him.<br/>Future generations shall be told about the Lord.<br/><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>They shall come and shall declare his righteousness to a people that shall be born,<br/>for he has done it.</p></blockquote></section>
