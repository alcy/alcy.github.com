    <h1>Paul's First Letter to Timothy</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and givings of thanks be made for all men,   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>for kings and all who are in high places, that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and reverence.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>who desires all people to be saved and come to full knowledge of the truth.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>who gave himself as a ransom for all, the testimony at the proper time,   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle—I am telling the truth in Christ, not lying—a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>I desire therefore that the men in every place pray, lifting up holy hands without anger and doubting.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>In the same way, that women also adorn themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and propriety, not<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="1ti-2-9-note-1">

<span class="sidenote">
        The word for “not” is the negative particle “μη” which denies an expected idea, as opposed to the usual word for “not” (ου) which denies a fact. Thus “μη” in this context is denying an expected idea (that women can be properly dressed without good works).
        </span> with braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive clothing,   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>but with good works, which is appropriate for women professing godliness.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Let a woman learn in quietness with full submission.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>But I don’t permit a woman to teach, nor to exercise authority over a man, but to be in quietness.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>For Adam was formed first, then Eve.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Adam wasn’t deceived, but the woman, being deceived, has fallen into disobedience;   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>but she will be saved through her childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and holiness with sobriety.</p></section>
