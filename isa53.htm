    <h2>Chapter 53</h2>
    
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Who has believed our message?<br/>To whom has the LORD’s arm been revealed?<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>For he grew up before him as a tender plant,<br/>and as a root out of dry ground.<br/>He has no good looks or majesty.<br/>When we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>He was despised<br/>and rejected by men,<br/>a man of suffering<br/>and acquainted with disease.<br/>He was despised as one from whom men hide their face;<br/>and we didn’t respect him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Surely he has borne our sickness<br/>and carried our suffering;<br/>yet we considered him plagued,<br/>struck by God, and afflicted.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>But he was pierced for our transgressions.<br/>He was crushed for our iniquities.<br/>The punishment that brought our peace was on him;<br/>and by his wounds we are healed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>All we like sheep have gone astray.<br/>Everyone has turned to his own way;<br/>and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>He was oppressed,<br/>yet when he was afflicted he didn’t open his mouth.<br/>As a lamb that is led to the slaughter,<br/>and as a sheep that before its shearers is silent,<br/>so he didn’t open his mouth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>He was taken away by oppression and judgment.<br/>As for his generation,<br/>who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living<br/>and stricken for the disobedience of my people?<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>They made his grave with the wicked,<br/>and with a rich man in his death,<br/>although he had done no violence,<br/>nor was any deceit in his mouth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him.<br/>He has caused him to suffer.<br/>When you make his soul an offering for sin,<br/>he will see his offspring.<br/>He will prolong his days<br/>and the LORD’s pleasure will prosper in his hand.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>After the suffering of his soul,<br/>he will see the light<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="isa-53-11-note-1">

<input class="margin-toggle" id="isa-53-11-note-1" type="checkbox"/>
<span class="sidenote">
            So read the Dead Sea Scrolls and Septuagint. Masoretic Text omits “the light”.
            </span> and be satisfied.<br/>My righteous servant will justify many by the knowledge of himself;<br/>and he will bear their iniquities.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Therefore I will give him a portion with the great.<br/>He will divide the plunder with the strong,<br/>because he poured out his soul to death<br/>and was counted with the transgressors;<br/>yet he bore the sins of many<br/>and made intercession for the transgressors.</p></blockquote></section>
