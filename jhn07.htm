    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>After these things, Jesus was walking in Galilee, for he wouldn’t walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was at hand.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>His brothers therefore said to him, “Depart from here and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works which you do.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>For no one does anything in secret while he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world.”   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>For even his brothers didn’t believe in him.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Jesus therefore said to them, <span class="wj">“My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready. </span> <span class="verse" id="V7"></span><span class="wj">The world can’t hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are evil. </span> <span class="verse" id="V8"></span><span class="wj">You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Having said these things to them, he stayed in Galilee.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, “Where is he?”   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said, “He is a good man.” Others said, “Not so, but he leads the multitude astray.”   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>But when it was now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>The Jews therefore marveled, saying, “How does this man know letters, having never been educated?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Jesus therefore answered them, <span class="wj">“My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me. </span> <span class="verse" id="V17"></span><span class="wj">If anyone desires to do his will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is from God or if I am speaking from myself. </span> <span class="verse" id="V18"></span><span class="wj">He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. </span> <span class="verse" id="V19"></span><span class="wj">Didn’t Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>The multitude answered, “You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Jesus answered them, <span class="wj">“I did one work and you all marvel because of it. </span> <span class="verse" id="V22"></span><span class="wj">Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy. </span> <span class="verse" id="V23"></span><span class="wj">If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath? </span> <span class="verse" id="V24"></span><span class="wj">Don’t judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.” </span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said, “Isn’t this he whom they seek to kill?   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ?   <span class="verse" id="V27"></span>However, we know where this man comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, <span class="wj">“You both know me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you don’t know. </span> <span class="verse" id="V29"></span><span class="wj">I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>They sought therefore to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.   <span class="verse" id="V31"></span>But of the multitude, many believed in him. They said, “When the Christ comes, he won’t do more signs than those which this man has done, will he?”   <span class="verse" id="V32"></span>The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V33"></span>Then Jesus said, <span class="wj">“I will be with you a little while longer, then I go to him who sent me. </span> <span class="verse" id="V34"></span><span class="wj">You will seek me and won’t find me. You can’t come where I am.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V35"></span>The Jews therefore said among themselves, “Where will this man go that we won’t find him? Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?   <span class="verse" id="V36"></span>What is this word that he said, <span class="wj">‘You will seek me, and won’t find me;’</span> and <span class="wj">‘Where I am, you can’t come’</span>?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V37"></span>Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, <span class="wj">“If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink! </span> <span class="verse" id="V38"></span><span class="wj">He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living water.”</span> <span class="verse" id="V39"></span>But he said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive. For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasn’t yet glorified.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V40"></span>Many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, “This is truly the prophet.”   <span class="verse" id="V41"></span>Others said, “This is the Christ.” But some said, “What, does the Christ come out of Galilee?   <span class="verse" id="V42"></span>Hasn’t the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the offspring<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="jhn-7-42-note-1">
