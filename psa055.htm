    <h1>Psalm 55</h1>

    <p class="psalm-subtitle">For the Chief Musician. On stringed instruments. A contemplation by David.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Listen to my prayer, God.<br/>Don’t hide yourself from my supplication.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Attend to me, and answer me.<br/>I am restless in my complaint,<br/>and moan   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>because of the voice of the enemy,<br/>because of the oppression of the wicked.<br/>For they bring suffering on me.<br/>In anger they hold a grudge against me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>My heart is severely pained within me.<br/>The terrors of death have fallen on me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Fearfulness and trembling have come on me.<br/>Horror has overwhelmed me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>I said, “Oh that I had wings like a dove!<br/>Then I would fly away, and be at rest.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Behold, then I would wander far off.<br/>I would lodge in the wilderness.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>“I would hurry to a shelter from the stormy wind and storm.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Confuse them, Lord, and confound their language,<br/>for I have seen violence and strife in the city.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Day and night they prowl around on its walls.<br/>Malice and abuse are also within her.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Destructive forces are within her.<br/>Threats and lies don’t depart from her streets.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>For it was not an enemy who insulted me,<br/>then I could have endured it.<br/>Neither was it he who hated me who raised himself up against me,<br/>then I would have hidden myself from him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>But it was you, a man like me,<br/>my companion, and my familiar friend.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>We took sweet fellowship together.<br/>We walked in God’s house with company.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Let death come suddenly on them.<br/>Let them go down alive into Sheol.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="psa-55-15-note-1">
</label>
<input class="margin-toggle" id="psa-55-15-note-1" type="checkbox"/>
<span class="sidenote">
            Sheol is the place of the dead.
            </span><br/>For wickedness is among them, in their dwelling.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>As for me, I will call on God.<br/>The LORD will save me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Evening, morning, and at noon, I will cry out in distress.<br/>He will hear my voice.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me,<br/>although there are many who oppose me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>God, who is enthroned forever,<br/>will hear and answer them.<br/>They never change<br/>and don’t fear God.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>He raises his hands against his friends.<br/>He has violated his covenant.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>His mouth was smooth as butter,<br/>but his heart was war.<br/>His words were softer than oil,<br/>yet they were drawn swords.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Cast your burden on the LORD and he will sustain you.<br/>He will never allow the righteous to be moved.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>But you, God, will bring them down into the pit of destruction.<br/>Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days,<br/>but I will trust in you.</p></blockquote></section>
