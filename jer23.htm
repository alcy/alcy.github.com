    <h2>Chapter 23</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>“Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!” says the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, says against the shepherds who feed my people: “You have scattered my flock, driven them away, and have not visited them. Behold, I will visit on you the evil of your doings,” says the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>“I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they will be fruitful and multiply.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>I will set up shepherds over them who will feed them. They will no longer be afraid or dismayed, neither will any be lacking,” says the LORD.</p><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>“Behold, the days come,” says the LORD,<br/>“that I will raise to David a righteous Branch;<br/>and he will reign as king and deal wisely,<br/>and will execute justice and righteousness in the land.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>In his days Judah will be saved,<br/>and Israel will dwell safely.<br/>This is his name by which he will be called:<br/>The LORD our righteousness.</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>“Therefore, behold, the days come,” says the LORD, “that they will no more say, ‘As the LORD lives, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;’   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>but, ‘As the LORD lives, who brought up and who led the offspring of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all the countries where I had driven them.’ Then they will dwell in their own land.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Concerning the prophets:</p><blockquote><p>My heart within me is broken.<br/>All my bones shake.<br/>I am like a drunken man,<br/>and like a man whom wine has overcome,<br/>because of the LORD,<br/>and because of his holy words.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>“For the land is full of adulterers;<br/>for because of the curse the land mourns.<br/>The pastures of the wilderness have dried up.<br/>Their course is evil,<br/>and their might is not right;<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>for both prophet and priest are profane.<br/>Yes, in my house I have found their wickedness,” says the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Therefore their way will be to them as slippery places in the darkness.<br/>They will be driven on,<br/>and fall therein;<br/>for I will bring evil on them,<br/>even the year of their visitation,” says the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>“I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria.<br/>They prophesied by Baal,<br/>and caused my people Israel to err.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>In the prophets of Jerusalem I have also seen a horrible thing:<br/>they commit adultery and walk in lies.<br/>They strengthen the hands of evildoers,<br/>so that no one returns from his wickedness.<br/>They have all become to me as Sodom,<br/>and its inhabitants as Gomorrah.”</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Therefore the LORD of Armies says concerning the prophets:</p><blockquote><p>“Behold, I will feed them with wormwood,<br/>and make them drink poisoned water;<br/>for from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has gone out into all the land.”</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>The LORD of Armies says,</p><blockquote><p>“Don’t listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you.<br/>They teach you vanity.<br/>They speak a vision of their own heart,<br/>and not out of the mouth of the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>They say continually to those who despise me,<br/>‘The LORD has said, “You will have peace;” ’<br/>and to everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart they say,<br/>‘No evil will come on you.’<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>For who has stood in the council of the LORD,<br/>that he should perceive and hear his word?<br/>Who has listened to my word, and heard it?<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Behold, the LORD’s storm, his wrath, has gone out.<br/>Yes, a whirling storm!<br/>It will burst on the head of the wicked.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>The LORD’s anger will not return until he has executed<br/>and performed the intents of his heart.<br/>In the latter days, you will understand it perfectly.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>I didn’t send these prophets, yet they ran.<br/>I didn’t speak to them, yet they prophesied.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>But if they had stood in my council,<br/>then they would have caused my people to hear my words,<br/>and would have turned them from their evil way,<br/>and from the evil of their doings.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>“Am I a God at hand,” says the LORD,<br/>“and not a God afar off?<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Can anyone hide himself in secret places<br/>so that I can’t see him?” says the LORD.<br/>“Don’t I fill heaven and earth?” says the LORD.</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>“I have heard what the prophets have said, who prophesy lies in my name, saying, ‘I had a dream! I had a dream!’   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>How long will this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies, even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart?   <span class="verse" id="V27"></span>They intend to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they each tell his neighbor, as their fathers forgot my name because of Baal.   <span class="verse" id="V28"></span>The prophet who has a dream, let him tell a dream; and he who has my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the straw to the wheat?” says the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V29"></span>“Isn’t my word like fire?” says the LORD; “and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?</p><p><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>“Therefore behold, I am against the prophets,” says the LORD, “who each steal my words from his neighbor.   <span class="verse" id="V31"></span>Behold, I am against the prophets,” says the LORD, “who use their tongues, and say, ‘He says.’   <span class="verse" id="V32"></span>Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams,” says the LORD, “who tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their vain boasting; yet I didn’t send them or command them. They don’t profit this people at all,” says the LORD.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V33"></span>“When this people, or the prophet, or a priest, asks you, saying, ‘What is the message from the LORD?’ Then you shall tell them, ‘ “What message? I will cast you off,” says the LORD.’   <span class="verse" id="V34"></span>As for the prophet, the priest, and the people, who say, ‘The message from the LORD,’ I will even punish that man and his household.   <span class="verse" id="V35"></span>You will say everyone to his neighbor, and everyone to his brother, ‘What has the LORD answered?’ and, ‘What has the LORD said?’   <span class="verse" id="V36"></span>You will mention the message from the LORD no more, for every man’s own word has become his message; for you have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of Armies, our God.   <span class="verse" id="V37"></span>You will say to the prophet, ‘What has the LORD answered you?’ and, ‘What has the LORD spoken?’   <span class="verse" id="V38"></span>Although you say, ‘The message from the LORD,’ therefore the LORD says: ‘Because you say this word, “The message from the LORD,” and I have sent to you, telling you not to say, “The message from the LORD,”   <span class="verse" id="V39"></span>therefore behold, I will utterly forget you, and I will cast you off with the city that I gave to you and to your fathers, away from my presence.   <span class="verse" id="V40"></span>I will bring an everlasting reproach on you, and a perpetual shame, which will not be forgotten.’ ” <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="jer24.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
