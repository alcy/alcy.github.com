            LORD or GOD in all caps is from the Hebrew יהוה Yahweh except when otherwise noted as being from the short form יה Yah.
            </span> Call on his name!<br/>Make his doings known among the peoples.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Sing to him, sing praises to him!<br/>Tell of all his marvelous works.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Glory in his holy name.<br/>Let the heart of those who seek the LORD rejoice.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Seek the LORD and his strength.<br/>Seek his face forever more.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Remember his marvelous works that he has done:<br/>his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>you offspring of Abraham, his servant,<br/>you children of Jacob, his chosen ones.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>He is the LORD, our God.<br/>His judgments are in all the earth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>He has remembered his covenant forever,<br/>the word which he commanded to a thousand generations,<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>the covenant which he made with Abraham,<br/>his oath to Isaac,<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>and confirmed it to Jacob for a statute;<br/>to Israel for an everlasting covenant,<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan,<br/>the lot of your inheritance,”<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>when they were but a few men in number,<br/>yes, very few, and foreigners in it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>They went about from nation to nation,<br/>from one kingdom to another people.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>He allowed no one to do them wrong.<br/>Yes, he reproved kings for their sakes,<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>“Don’t touch my anointed ones!<br/>Do my prophets no harm!”<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>He called for a famine on the land.<br/>He destroyed the food supplies.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>He sent a man before them.<br/>Joseph was sold for a slave.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>They bruised his feet with shackles.<br/>His neck was locked in irons,<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>until the time that his word happened,<br/>and the LORD’s word proved him true.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>The king sent and freed him,<br/>even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>He made him lord of his house,<br/>and ruler of all of his possessions,<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>to discipline his princes at his pleasure,<br/>and to teach his elders wisdom.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Israel also came into Egypt.<br/>Jacob lived in the land of Ham.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>He increased his people greatly,<br/>and made them stronger than their adversaries.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>He turned their heart to hate his people,<br/>to conspire against his servants.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>He sent Moses, his servant,<br/>and Aaron, whom he had chosen.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>They performed miracles among them,<br/>and wonders in the land of Ham.<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>He sent darkness, and made it dark.<br/>They didn’t rebel against his words.<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>He turned their waters into blood,<br/>and killed their fish.<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>Their land swarmed with frogs,<br/>even in the rooms of their kings.<br/><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>He spoke, and swarms of flies came,<br/>and lice in all their borders.<br/><span class="verse" id="V32"></span>He gave them hail for rain,<br/>with lightning in their land.<br/><span class="verse" id="V33"></span>He struck their vines and also their fig trees,<br/>and shattered the trees of their country.<br/><span class="verse" id="V34"></span>He spoke, and the locusts came<br/>with the grasshoppers, without number.<br/><span class="verse" id="V35"></span>They ate up every plant in their land,<br/>and ate up the fruit of their ground.<br/><span class="verse" id="V36"></span>He struck also all the firstborn in their land,<br/>the first fruits of all their manhood.<br/><span class="verse" id="V37"></span>He brought them out with silver and gold.<br/>There was not one feeble person among his tribes.<br/><span class="verse" id="V38"></span>Egypt was glad when they departed,<br/>for the fear of them had fallen on them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V39"></span>He spread a cloud for a covering,<br/>fire to give light in the night.<br/><span class="verse" id="V40"></span>They asked, and he brought quails,<br/>and satisfied them with the bread of the sky.<br/><span class="verse" id="V41"></span>He opened the rock, and waters gushed out.<br/>They ran as a river in the dry places.<br/><span class="verse" id="V42"></span>For he remembered his holy word,<br/>and Abraham, his servant.<br/><span class="verse" id="V43"></span>He brought his people out with joy,<br/>his chosen with singing.<br/><span class="verse" id="V44"></span>He gave them the lands of the nations.<br/>They took the labor of the peoples in possession,<br/><span class="verse" id="V45"></span>that they might keep his statutes,<br/>and observe his laws.<br/>Praise the LORD!<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"
