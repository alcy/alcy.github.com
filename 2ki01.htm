He said to him, “Man of God, the king has said, ‘Come down!’ ”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Elijah answered to the captain of fifty, “If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from the sky and consume you and your fifty!” Then fire came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Again he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. He answered him, “Man of God, the king has said, ‘Come down quickly!’ ”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Elijah answered them, “If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from the sky and consume you and your fifty!” Then God’s fire came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. The third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and begged him, and said to him, “Man of God, please let my life and the life of these fifty of your servants be precious in your sight.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Behold, fire came down from the sky and consumed the last two captains of fifty with their fifties. But now let my life be precious in your sight.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>The LORD’s angel said to Elijah, “Go down with him. Don’t be afraid of him.”</p><p>Then he arose and went down with him to the king.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>He said to him, “The LORD says, ‘Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? Therefore you will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you will surely die.’ ”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>So he died according to the LORD’s word which Elijah had spoken. Jehoram began to reign in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, because he had no son.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p></section>
