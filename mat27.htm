    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>They bound him, led him away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>saying, “I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood.”</p><p>But they said, “What is that to us? You see to it.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>He threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary and departed. Then he went away and hanged himself.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>The chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, “It’s not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.”   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>They took counsel, and bought the potter’s field with them to bury strangers in.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Therefore that field has been called “The Field of Blood” to this day.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="mat-27-9-note-1">

</span></p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Now Jesus stood before the governor; and the governor asked him, saying, “Are you the King of the Jews?”</p><p>Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“So you say.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>When he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Then Pilate said to him, “Don’t you hear how many things they testify against you?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>He gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner whom they desired.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>They had then a notable prisoner called Barabbas.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?”   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of him.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>But the governor answered them, “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?”</p><p>They said, “Barabbas!”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Pilate said to them, “What then shall I do to Jesus who is called Christ?”</p><p>They all said to him, “Let him be crucified!”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>But the governor said, “Why? What evil has he done?”</p><p>But they cried out exceedingly, saying, “Let him be crucified!”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>So when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, “I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>All the people answered, “May his blood be on us and on our children!”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>Then he released Barabbas to them, but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together against him.   <span class="verse" id="V28"></span>They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him.   <span class="verse" id="V29"></span>They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him and mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”   <span class="verse" id="V30"></span>They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.   <span class="verse" id="V31"></span>When they had mocked him, they took the robe off him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V32"></span>As they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to go with them, that he might carry his cross.   <span class="verse" id="V33"></span>When they came to a place called “Golgotha”, that is to say, “The place of a skull,”   <span class="verse" id="V34"></span>they gave him sour wine<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="mat-27-34-note-1">
