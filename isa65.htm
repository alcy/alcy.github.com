    <h1>Isaiah</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 65</h2>
    
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>“I am inquired of by those who didn’t ask.<br/>I am found by those who didn’t seek me.<br/>I said, ‘See me, see me,’ to a nation that was not called by my name.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>I have spread out my hands all day to a rebellious people,<br/>who walk in a way that is not good,<br/>after their own thoughts;<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>a people who provoke me to my face continually,<br/>sacrificing in gardens,<br/>and burning incense on bricks;<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>who sit among the graves,<br/>and spend nights in secret places;<br/>who eat pig’s meat,<br/>and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>who say, ‘Stay by yourself,<br/>don’t come near to me,<br/>for I am holier than you.’<br/>These are smoke in my nose,<br/>a fire that burns all day.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>“Behold, it is written before me:<br/>I will not keep silence,<br/>but will repay,<br/>yes, I will repay into their bosom<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>your own iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together”, says the LORD,<br/>“who have burned incense on the mountains,<br/>and blasphemed me on the hills.<br/>Therefore I will first measure their work into their bosom.”</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>The LORD says,</p><blockquote><p>“As the new wine is found in the cluster,<br/>and one says, ‘Don’t destroy it, for a blessing is in it:’<br/>so I will do for my servants’ sake,<br/>that I may not destroy them all.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>I will bring offspring out of Jacob,<br/>and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains.<br/>My chosen will inherit it,<br/>and my servants will dwell there.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Sharon will be a fold of flocks,<br/>and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in,<br/>for my people who have sought me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>“But you who forsake the LORD,<br/>who forget my holy mountain,<br/>who prepare a table for Fortune,<br/>and who fill up mixed wine to Destiny;<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>I will destine you to the sword,<br/>and you will all bow down to the slaughter;<br/>because when I called, you didn’t answer.<br/>When I spoke, you didn’t listen;<br/>but you did that which was evil in my eyes,<br/>and chose that in which I didn’t delight.”</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Therefore the Lord GOD says,</p><blockquote><p>“Behold, my servants will eat,<br/>but you will be hungry;<br/>behold, my servants will drink,<br/>but you will be thirsty.<br/>Behold, my servants will rejoice,<br/>but you will be disappointed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Behold, my servants will sing for joy of heart,<br/>but you will cry for sorrow of heart,<br/>and will wail for anguish of spirit.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>You will leave your name for a curse to my chosen,<br/>and the Lord GOD will kill you.<br/>He will call his servants by another name,<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>so that he who blesses himself in the earth will bless himself in the God of truth;<br/>and he who swears in the earth will swear by the God of truth;<br/>because the former troubles are forgotten,<br/>and because they are hidden from my eyes.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>“For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth;<br/>and the former things will not be remembered,<br/>nor come into mind.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>But be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create;<br/>for, behold, I create Jerusalem to be a delight,<br/>and her people a joy.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>I will rejoice in Jerusalem,<br/>and delight in my people;<br/>and the voice of weeping and the voice of crying<br/>will be heard in her no more.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>“No more will there be an infant who only lives a few days,<br/>nor an old man who has not filled his days;<br/>for the child will die one hundred years old,<br/>and the sinner being one hundred years old will be accursed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>They will build houses and inhabit them.<br/>They will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>They will not build and another inhabit.<br/>They will not plant and another eat;<br/>for the days of my people will be like the days of a tree,<br/>and my chosen will long enjoy the work of their hands.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>They will not labor in vain<br/>nor give birth for calamity;<br/>for they are the offspring of the LORD’s blessed<br/>and their descendants with them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>It will happen that before they call, I will answer;<br/>and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>The wolf and the lamb will feed together.<br/>The lion will eat straw like the ox.<br/>Dust will be the serpent’s food.<br/>They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain,”<br/>says the LORD.</p></blockquote></section>
