    <h1>Luke</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 18</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>He also spoke a parable to them that they must always pray and not give up,   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>saying, <span class="wj">“There was a judge in a certain city who didn’t fear God and didn’t respect man. </span> <span class="verse" id="V3"></span><span class="wj">A widow was in that city, and she often came to him, saying, ‘Defend me from my adversary!’ </span> <span class="verse" id="V4"></span><span class="wj">He wouldn’t for a while; but afterward he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God nor respect man, </span> <span class="verse" id="V5"></span><span class="wj">yet because this widow bothers me, I will defend her, or else she will wear me out by her continual coming.’ ”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>The Lord said, <span class="wj">“Listen to what the unrighteous judge says. </span> <span class="verse" id="V7"></span><span class="wj">Won’t God avenge his chosen ones who are crying out to him day and night, and yet he exercises patience with them? </span> <span class="verse" id="V8"></span><span class="wj">I tell you that he will avenge them quickly. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>He also spoke this parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness, and who despised all others:   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span><span class="wj">“Two men went up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector. </span> <span class="verse" id="V11"></span><span class="wj">The Pharisee stood and prayed by himself like this: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like the rest of men: extortionists, unrighteous, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. </span> <span class="verse" id="V12"></span><span class="wj">I fast twice a week. I give tithes of all that I get.’ </span> <span class="verse" id="V13"></span><span class="wj">But the tax collector, standing far away, wouldn’t even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his chest, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’ </span> <span class="verse" id="V14"></span><span class="wj">I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>They were also bringing their babies to him, that he might touch them. But when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Jesus summoned them, saying, <span class="wj">“Allow the little children to come to me, and don’t hinder them, for God’s Kingdom belongs to such as these. </span> <span class="verse" id="V17"></span><span class="wj">Most certainly, I tell you, whoever doesn’t receive God’s Kingdom like a little child, he will in no way enter into it.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>A certain ruler asked him, saying, “Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Jesus asked him, <span class="wj">“Why do you call me good? No one is good, except one: God. </span> <span class="verse" id="V20"></span><span class="wj">You know the commandments: ‘Don’t commit adultery,’ ‘Don’t murder,’ ‘Don’t steal,’ ‘Don’t give false testimony,’ ‘Honor your father and your mother.’ ”</span><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="luk-18-20-note-1">

</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>He said, “I have observed all these things from my youth up.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>When Jesus heard these things, he said to him, <span class="wj">“You still lack one thing. Sell all that you have and distribute it to the poor. Then you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was very rich.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Jesus, seeing that he became very sad, said, <span class="wj">“How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into God’s Kingdom! </span> <span class="verse" id="V25"></span><span class="wj">For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to enter into God’s Kingdom.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>Those who heard it said, “Then who can be saved?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>But he said, <span class="wj">“The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>Peter said, “Look, we have left everything and followed you.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for God’s Kingdom’s sake, </span> <span class="verse" id="V30"></span><span class="wj">who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the world to come, eternal life.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>He took the twelve aside and said to them, <span class="wj">“Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be completed. </span> <span class="verse" id="V32"></span><span class="wj">For he will be delivered up to the Gentiles, will be mocked, treated shamefully, and spit on. </span> <span class="verse" id="V33"></span><span class="wj">They will scourge and kill him. On the third day, he will rise again.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V34"></span>They understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they didn’t understand the things that were said.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V35"></span>As he came near Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the road, begging.   <span class="verse" id="V36"></span>Hearing a multitude going by, he asked what this meant.   <span class="verse" id="V37"></span>They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.   <span class="verse" id="V38"></span>He cried out, “Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me!”   <span class="verse" id="V39"></span>Those who led the way rebuked him, that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, “You son of David, have mercy on me!”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V40"></span>Standing still, Jesus commanded him to be brought to him. When he had come near, he asked him,   <span class="verse" id="V41"></span><span class="wj">“What do you want me to do?”</span></p><p>He said, “Lord, that I may see again.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V42"></span>Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“Receive your sight. Your faith has healed you.” </span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V43"></span>Immediately he received his sight and followed him, glorifying God. All the people, when they saw it, praised God. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="luk19.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
