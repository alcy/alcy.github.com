They were bound by the archers. All who were found by you were bound together. They fled far away.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Therefore I said, “Look away from me. I will weep bitterly. Don’t labor to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>For it is a day of confusion, and of treading down, and of perplexity from the Lord, GOD<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="isa-22-5-note-1">

But you didn’t look to him who had done this, neither did you have respect for him who planned it long ago.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>In that day, the Lord, GOD<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="isa-22-12-note-1">

Who has you here, that you have dug out a tomb here?’ Cutting himself out a tomb on high, chiseling a habitation for himself in the rock!”   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Behold, the LORD will overcome you and hurl you away violently. Yes, he will grasp you firmly.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>He will surely wind you around and around, and throw you like a ball into a large country.

I will commit your government into his hand; and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>I will lay the key of David’s house on his shoulder. He will open, and no one will shut. He will shut, and no one will open.   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>I will fasten him like a nail in a sure place. He will be for a throne of glory to his father’s house.   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>They will hang on him all the glory of his father’s house, the offspring and the issue, every small vessel, from the cups even to all the pitchers.   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>“In that day,” says the LORD of Armies, “the nail that was fastened in a sure place will give way. It will be cut down and fall. The burden that was on it will be cut off, for the LORD has spoken it.”</p></section>
