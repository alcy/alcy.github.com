<span class="sidenote">
        The Hellenists used Greek language and culture, even though they were also of Hebrew descent.
        </span> against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily service.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>The twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, “It is not appropriate for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Therefore, select from among you, brothers, seven men of good report, full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>These words pleased the whole multitude. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch,   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>whom they set before the apostles. When they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>The word of God increased and the number of the disciples greatly multiplied in Jerusalem. A great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Stephen, full of faith and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>But some of those who were of the synagogue called “The Libertines”, and of the Cyrenians, of the Alexandrians, and of those of Cilicia and Asia arose, disputing with Stephen.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>They weren’t able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Then they secretly induced men to say, “We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.”   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes, and came against him and seized him, then brought him in to the council,   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>and set up false witnesses who said, “This man never stops speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the law.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us.”   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>All who sat in the council, fastening their eyes on him, saw his face like it was the face of an angel.</p></section>
