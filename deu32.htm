            For this verse, LXX reads: Rejoice, you heavens, with him, and let all the angels of God worship him; rejoice you Gentiles, with his people, and let all the sons of God strengthen themselves in him; for he will avenge the blood of his sons, and he will give vengeance, and recompense justice to his enemies, and will reward them that hate him; and the Lord shall purge the land of his people.
