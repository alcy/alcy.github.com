    <h1>Paul's Letter to the Romans</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>I ask then, did God reject his people? May it never be! For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>God didn’t reject his people, whom he foreknew. Or don’t you know what the Scripture says about Elijah? How he pleads with God against Israel:   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>“Lord, they have killed your prophets. They have broken down your altars. I am left alone, and they seek my life.”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="rom-11-3-note-1">

</span> <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Even so too at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. But if it is of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>What then? That which Israel seeks for, that he didn’t obtain, but the chosen ones obtained it, and the rest were hardened.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>According as it is written, “God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, to this very day.” <label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="rom-11-8-note-1">

</span></p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>I ask then, did they stumble that they might fall? May it never be! But by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fullness!</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>For I speak to you who are Gentiles. Since then as I am an apostle to Gentiles, I glorify my ministry,   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh, and may save some of them.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>For if the rejection of them is the reconciling of the world, what would their acceptance be, but life from the dead?</p><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>If the first fruit is holy, so is the lump. If the root is holy, so are the branches.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became partaker with them of the root and of the richness of the olive tree,   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>don’t boast over the branches. But if you boast, remember that it is not you who support the root, but the root supports you.   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>You will say then, “Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.”   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>True; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by your faith. Don’t be conceited, but fear;   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>for if God didn’t spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>See then the goodness and severity of God. Toward those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness; otherwise you also will be cut off.   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>They also, if they don’t continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more will these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?</p><p><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>For I don’t desire you to be ignorant, brothers,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="rom-11-25-note-1">

        </span> of this mystery, so that you won’t be wise in your own conceits, that a partial hardening has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in,   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>and so all Israel will be saved. Even as it is written,</p><blockquote><p>“There will come out of Zion the Deliverer,<br/>and he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>This is my covenant with them,<br/>when I will take away their sins.”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="rom-11-27-note-1">

But concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sake.   <span class="verse" id="V29"></span>For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.   <span class="verse" id="V30"></span>For as you in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,   <span class="verse" id="V31"></span>even so these also have now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they may also obtain mercy.   <span class="verse" id="V32"></span>For God has bound all to disobedience, that he might have mercy on all.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V33"></span>Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God!
