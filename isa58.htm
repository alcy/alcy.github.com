    <h2>Chapter 58</h2>
    
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>“Cry aloud! Don’t spare!<br/>Lift up your voice like a trumpet!<br/>Declare to my people their disobedience,<br/>and to the house of Jacob their sins.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Yet they seek me daily,<br/>and delight to know my ways.<br/>As a nation that did righteousness,<br/>and didn’t forsake the ordinance of their God,<br/>they ask of me righteous judgments.<br/>They delight to draw near to God.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>‘Why have we fasted,’ they say, ‘and you don’t see?<br/>Why have we afflicted our soul, and you don’t notice?’<br/>“Behold, in the day of your fast you find pleasure,<br/>and oppress all your laborers.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Behold, you fast for strife and contention,<br/>and to strike with the fist of wickedness.<br/>You don’t fast today so as to make your voice to be heard on high.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Is this the fast that I have chosen?<br/>A day for a man to humble his soul?<br/>Is it to bow down his head like a reed,<br/>and to spread sackcloth and ashes under himself?<br/>Will you call this a fast,<br/>and an acceptable day to the LORD?<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>“Isn’t this the fast that I have chosen:<br/>to release the bonds of wickedness,<br/>to undo the straps of the yoke,<br/>to let the oppressed go free,<br/>and that you break every yoke?<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Isn’t it to distribute your bread to the hungry,<br/>and that you bring the poor who are cast out to your house?<br/>When you see the naked,<br/>that you cover him;<br/>and that you not hide yourself from your own flesh?<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Then your light will break out as the morning,<br/>and your healing will appear quickly;<br/>then your righteousness shall go before you,<br/>and the LORD’s glory will be your rear guard.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Then you will call, and the LORD will answer.<br/>You will cry for help, and he will say, ‘Here I am.’<br/>“If you take away from among you the yoke,<br/>finger pointing,<br/>and speaking wickedly;<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>and if you pour out your soul to the hungry,<br/>and satisfy the afflicted soul,<br/>then your light will rise in darkness,<br/>and your obscurity will be as the noonday;<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>and the LORD will guide you continually,<br/>satisfy your soul in dry places,<br/>and make your bones strong.<br/>You will be like a watered garden,<br/>and like a spring of water<br/>whose waters don’t fail.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Those who will be of you will build the old waste places.<br/>You will raise up the foundations of many generations.<br/>You will be called Repairer of the Breach,<br/>Restorer of Paths with Dwellings.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>“If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath,<br/>from doing your pleasure on my holy day,<br/>and call the Sabbath a delight,<br/>and the holy of the LORD honorable,<br/>and honor it,<br/>not doing your own ways,<br/>nor finding your own pleasure,<br/>nor speaking your own words,<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>then you will delight yourself in the LORD,<br/>and I will make you to ride on the high places of the earth,<br/>and I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father;”<br/>for the LORD’s mouth has spoken it.</p></blockquote></section>
