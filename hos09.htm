    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Don’t rejoice, Israel, to jubilation like the nations;</p><blockquote><p>for you were unfaithful to your God.<br/>You love the wages of a prostitute at every grain threshing floor.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>The threshing floor and the wine press won’t feed them,<br/>and the new wine will fail her.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>They won’t dwell in the LORD’s land;<br/>but Ephraim will return to Egypt,<br/>and they will eat unclean food in Assyria.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>They won’t pour out wine offerings to the LORD,<br/>neither will they be pleasing to him.<br/>Their sacrifices will be to them like the bread of mourners;<br/>all who eat of it will be polluted;<br/>for their bread will be for their appetite.<br/>It will not come into the LORD’s house.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>What will you do in the day of solemn assembly,<br/>and in the day of the feast of the LORD?<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>For, behold, when they flee destruction,<br/>Egypt will gather them up.<br/>Memphis will bury them.<br/>Nettles will possess their pleasant things of silver.<br/>Thorns will be in their tents.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>The days of visitation have come.<br/>The days of reckoning have come.<br/>Israel will consider the prophet to be a fool,<br/>and the man who is inspired to be insane,<br/>because of the abundance of your sins,<br/>and because your hostility is great.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>A prophet watches over Ephraim with my God.<br/>A fowler’s snare is on all of his paths,<br/>and hostility in the house of his God.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>They have deeply corrupted themselves,<br/>as in the days of Gibeah.<br/>He will remember their iniquity.<br/>He will punish them for their sins.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness.<br/>I saw your fathers as the first ripe in the fig tree at its first season;<br/>but they came to Baal Peor, and consecrated themselves to the shameful thing,<br/>and became abominable like that which they loved.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird.<br/>There will be no birth, no one with child, and no conception.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Though they bring up their children,<br/>yet I will bereave them, so that not a man shall be left.<br/>Indeed, woe also to them when I depart from them!<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>I have seen Ephraim, like Tyre, planted in a pleasant place;<br/>but Ephraim will bring out his children to the murderer.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Give them—LORD what will you give?<br/>Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>“All their wickedness is in Gilgal;<br/>for there I hated them.<br/>Because of the wickedness of their deeds, I will drive them out of my house!<br/>I will love them no more.<br/>All their princes are rebels.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Ephraim is struck.<br/>Their root has dried up.<br/>They will bear no fruit.<br/>Even though they give birth, yet I will kill the beloved ones of their womb.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>My God will cast them away, because they didn’t listen to him;<br/>and they will be wanderers among the nations.</p></blockquote></section>
