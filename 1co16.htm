    <h1>Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 16</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Now concerning the collection for the saints: as I commanded the assemblies of Galatia, you do likewise.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>On the first day of every week, let each one of you save as he may prosper, that no collections are made when I come.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>When I arrive, I will send whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>If it is appropriate for me to go also, they will go with me.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>I will come to you when I have passed through Macedonia, for I am passing through Macedonia.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>But with you it may be that I will stay with you, or even winter with you, that you may send me on my journey wherever I go.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>For I do not wish to see you now in passing, but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost,   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>for a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear, for he does the work of the Lord, as I also do.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Therefore let no one despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brothers.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Now concerning Apollos the brother, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers, but it was not at all his desire to come now; but he will come when he has an opportunity.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Watch! Stand firm in the faith! Be courageous! Be strong!   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Let all that you do be done in love.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Now I beg you, brothers—you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to serve the saints—   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>that you also be in subjection to such, and to everyone who helps in the work and labors.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus; for that which was lacking on your part, they supplied.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge those who are like that.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>The assemblies of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you warmly in the Lord, together with the assembly that is in their house.   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>This greeting is by me, Paul, with my own hand.   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>If any man doesn’t love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be cursed.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="1co-16-22-note-1">
