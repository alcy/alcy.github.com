        NU ends Jesus’ direct quote and question after “latrine”, ending the verse with “Thus he declared all foods clean.
        </span> <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>He said, <span class="wj">“That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man. </span> <span class="verse" id="V21"></span><span class="wj">For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts, </span> <span class="verse" id="V22"></span><span class="wj">covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness. </span> <span class="verse" id="V23"></span><span class="wj">All these evil things come from within and defile the man.” </span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>From there he arose and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house and didn’t want anyone to know it, but he couldn’t escape notice.   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>For a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.   <span class="verse" id="V27"></span>But Jesus said to her, <span class="wj">“Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.” </span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>But she answered him, “Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>He said to her, <span class="wj">“For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>She went away to her house, and found the child having been laid on the bed, with the demon gone out.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>Again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee through the middle of the region of Decapolis.   <span class="verse" id="V32"></span>They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand on him.   <span class="verse" id="V33"></span>He took him aside from the multitude privately and put his fingers into his ears; and he spat and touched his tongue.   <span class="verse" id="V34"></span>Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, <span class="wj">“Ephphatha!” </span> that is, <span class="wj">“Be opened!”</span> <span class="verse" id="V35"></span>Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly.   <span class="verse" id="V36"></span>He commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it.   <span class="verse" id="V37"></span>They were astonished beyond measure, saying, “He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear and the mute speak!”</p></section>
