    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Now on the second Sabbath after the first, he was going through the grain fields. His disciples plucked the heads of grain and ate, rubbing them in their hands.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>But some of the Pharisees said to them, “Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Jesus, answering them, said, <span class="wj">“Haven’t you read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him, </span> <span class="verse" id="V4"></span><span class="wj">how he entered into God’s house, and took and ate the show bread, and gave also to those who were with him, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone?”</span> <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>It also happened on another Sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught. There was a man there, and his right hand was withered.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>The scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find an accusation against him.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man who had the withered hand, <span class="wj">“Rise up and stand in the middle.”</span> He arose and stood.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“I will ask you something: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?”</span> <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>He looked around at them all, and said to the man, <span class="wj">“Stretch out your hand.”</span> He did, and his hand was restored as sound as the other.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>But they were filled with rage, and talked with one another about what they might do to Jesus.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>In these days, he went out to the mountain to pray, and he continued all night in prayer to God.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>When it was day, he called his disciples, and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles:   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Simon, whom he also named Peter; Andrew, his brother; James; John; Philip; Bartholomew;   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Matthew; Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus; Simon who was called the Zealot;   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Judas the son of James; and Judas Iscariot, who also became a traitor.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>He came down with them and stood on a level place, with a crowd of his disciples and a great number of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases,   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>as well as those who were troubled by unclean spirits; and they were being healed.   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>All the multitude sought to touch him, for power came out of him and healed them all.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>He lifted up his eyes to his disciples, and said:</p><blockquote><p><span class="wj">“Blessed are you who are poor,</span><br/><span class="wj">for God’s Kingdom is yours.</span><br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span><span class="wj">Blessed are you who hunger now,</span><br/><span class="wj">for you will be filled.</span><br/><span class="wj">Blessed are you who weep now,</span><br/><span class="wj">for you will laugh.</span><br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span><span class="wj">Blessed are you when men hate you, and when they exclude and mock you, and throw out your name as evil, for the Son of Man’s sake. </span><br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span><span class="wj">Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven, for their fathers did the same thing to the prophets.</span><br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span><span class="wj">“But woe to you who are rich!</span><br/><span class="wj">For you have received your consolation.</span><br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span><span class="wj">Woe to you, you who are full now,</span><br/><span class="wj">for you will be hungry.</span><br/><span class="wj">Woe to you who laugh now,</span><br/><span class="wj">for you will mourn and weep.</span><br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span><span class="wj">Woe,</span><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="luk-6-26-note-1">
