            or, The stronghold
            </span> is put to shame<br/>and broken down.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>The praise of Moab is no more.<br/>In Heshbon they have devised evil against her:<br/>‘Come! Let’s cut her off from being a nation.’<br/>You also, Madmen, will be brought to silence.<br/>The sword will pursue you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>The sound of a cry from Horonaim,<br/>desolation and great destruction!<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Moab is destroyed.<br/>Her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>For they will go up by the ascent of Luhith with continual weeping.<br/>For at the descent of Horonaim they have heard the distress of the cry of destruction.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Flee! Save your lives!<br/>Be like the juniper bush in the wilderness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>For, because you have trusted in your works and in your treasures,<br/>you also will be taken.<br/>Chemosh will go out into captivity,<br/>his priests and his princes together.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>The destroyer will come on every city,<br/>and no city will escape;<br/>the valley also will perish,<br/>and the plain will be destroyed, as the LORD has spoken.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Give wings to Moab,<br/>that she may fly and get herself away:<br/>and her cities will become a desolation,<br/>without anyone to dwell in them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>“Cursed is he who does the work of the LORD negligently;<br/>and cursed is he who keeps back his sword from blood.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>“Moab has been at ease from his youth,<br/>and he has settled on his dregs,<br/>and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel,<br/>neither has he gone into captivity;<br/>therefore his taste remains in him,<br/>and his scent is not changed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Therefore behold, the days come,” says the LORD,<br/>“that I will send to him those who pour off,<br/>and they will pour him off;<br/>and they will empty his vessels,<br/>and break their containers in pieces.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh,<br/>as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, their confidence.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>“How do you say, ‘We are mighty men,<br/>and valiant men for the war’?<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Moab is laid waste,<br/>and they have gone up into his cities,<br/>and his chosen young men have gone down to the slaughter,”<br/>says the King, whose name is the LORD of Armies.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>“The calamity of Moab is near to come,<br/>and his affliction hurries fast.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>All you who are around him, bemoan him;<br/>and all you who know his name, say,<br/>‘How the strong staff is broken,<br/>the beautiful rod!’<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>“You daughter who dwells in Dibon,<br/>come down from your glory,<br/>and sit in thirst;<br/>for the destroyer of Moab has come up against you.<br/>He has destroyed your strongholds.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way and watch.<br/>Ask him who flees, and her who escapes;<br/>say, ‘What has been done?’<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Moab is disappointed;<br/>for it is broken down.<br/>Wail and cry!<br/>Tell it by the Arnon, that Moab is laid waste.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Judgment has come on the plain country—<br/>on Holon, on Jahzah, on Mephaath,<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>on Dibon, on Nebo, on Beth Diblathaim,<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>on Kiriathaim, on Beth Gamul, on Beth Meon,<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>on Kerioth, on Bozrah,<br/>and on all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>The horn of Moab is cut off,<br/>and his arm is broken,” says the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>“Make him drunk,<br/>for he magnified himself against the LORD.<br/>Moab will wallow in his vomit,<br/>and he also will be in derision.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>For wasn’t Israel a derision to you?<br/>Was he found among thieves?<br/>For as often as you speak of him,<br/>you shake your head.<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>You inhabitants of Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock.<br/>Be like the dove that makes her nest over the mouth of the abyss.<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>“We have heard of the pride of Moab.<br/>He is very proud in his loftiness, his pride,<br/>his arrogance, and the arrogance of his heart.<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>I know his wrath,” says the LORD, “that it is nothing;<br/>his boastings have done nothing.<br/><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>Therefore I will wail for Moab.<br/>Yes, I will cry out for all Moab.<br/>They will mourn for the men of Kir Heres.<br/><span class="verse" id="V32"></span>With more than the weeping of Jazer<br/>I will weep for you, vine of Sibmah.<br/>Your branches passed over the sea.<br/>They reached even to the sea of Jazer.<br/>The destroyer has fallen on your summer fruits<br/>and on your vintage.<br/><span class="verse" id="V33"></span>Gladness and joy is taken away from the fruitful field<br/>and from the land of Moab.<br/>I have caused wine to cease from the wine presses.<br/>No one will tread with shouting.<br/>The shouting will be no shouting.<br/><span class="verse" id="V34"></span>From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh,<br/>even to Jahaz they have uttered their voice,<br/>from Zoar even to Horonaim, to Eglath Shelishiyah;<br/>for the waters of Nimrim will also become desolate.<br/><span class="verse" id="V35"></span>Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab,” says the LORD,<br/>“him who offers in the high place,<br/>and him who burns incense to his gods.<br/><span class="verse" id="V36"></span>Therefore my heart sounds for Moab like flutes,<br/>and my heart sounds like flutes for the men of Kir Heres.<br/>Therefore the abundance that he has gotten has perished.<br/><span class="verse" id="V37"></span>For every head is bald,<br/>and every beard clipped.<br/>There are cuttings on all the hands,<br/>and sackcloth on the waist.<br/><span class="verse" id="V38"></span>On all the housetops of Moab,<br/>and in its streets, there is lamentation everywhere;<br/>for I have broken Moab like a vessel in which no one delights,” says the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V39"></span>“How it is broken down!<br/>How they wail!<br/>How Moab has turned the back with shame!<br/>So will Moab become a derision<br/>and a terror to all who are around him.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V40"></span>For the LORD says: “Behold, he will fly as an eagle,<br/>and will spread out his wings against Moab.<br/><span class="verse" id="V41"></span>Kerioth is taken,<br/>and the strongholds are seized.<br/>The heart of the mighty men of Moab at that day<br/>will be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.<br/><span class="verse" id="V42"></span>Moab will be destroyed from being a people,<br/>because he has magnified himself against the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V43"></span>Terror, the pit, and the snare are on you,<br/>inhabitant of Moab,” says the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V44"></span>“He who flees from the terror will fall into the pit;<br/>and he who gets up out of the pit will be taken in the snare,<br/>for I will bring on him, even on Moab,<br/>the year of their visitation,” says the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V45"></span>“Those who fled stand without strength under the shadow of Heshbon;<br/>for a fire has gone out of Heshbon,<br/>and a flame from the middle of Sihon,<br/>and has devoured the corner of Moab,<br/>and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.<br/><span class="verse" id="V46"></span>Woe to you, O Moab!<br/>The people of Chemosh are undone;<br/>for your sons are taken away captive,<br/>and your daughters into captivity.<br/><span class="verse" id="V47"></span>“Yet I will reverse the captivity of Moab in the latter days,”<br/>says the LORD.</p></blockquote><p>Thus far is the judgment of Moab.</p></section>
