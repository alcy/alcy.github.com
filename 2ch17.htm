    <h1>The Second Book of Chronicles</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 17</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place, and strengthened himself against Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>He placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>The LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and didn’t seek the Baals,   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>but sought the God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not in the ways of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand. All Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he had riches and honor in abundance.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>His heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD. Furthermore, he took away the high places and the Asherah poles out of Judah.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes, even Ben Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>and with them Levites, even Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>They taught in Judah, having the book of the LORD’s law with them. They went about throughout all the cities of Judah and taught among the people.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>The fear of the LORD fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver for tribute. The Arabians also brought him flocks: seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred male goats.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Jehoshaphat grew great exceedingly; and he built fortresses and store cities in Judah.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>He had many works in the cities of Judah; and men of war, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>This was the numbering of them according to their fathers’ houses: From Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him three hundred thousand mighty men of valor;   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>and next to him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred eighty thousand;   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself to the LORD, and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>From Benjamin: Eliada, a mighty man of valor, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield;   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>and next to him Jehozabad, and with him one hundred eighty thousand ready and prepared for war.   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>These were those who waited on the king, in addition to those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.</p></section>
