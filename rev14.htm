    <h1>The Revelation to John</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 14</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him a number, one hundred forty-four thousand, having his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>I heard a sound from heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of a great thunder. The sound which I heard was like that of harpists playing on their harps.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>They sing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the one hundred forty-four thousand, those who had been redeemed out of the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>These are those who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are those who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were redeemed by Jesus from among men, the first fruits to God and to the Lamb.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>In their mouth was found no lie, for they are blameless.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="rev-14-5-note-1">

Worship him who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and the springs of waters!”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Another, a second angel, followed, saying, “Babylon the great has fallen, which has made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, “If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger. He will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>The smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever. They have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Here is the perseverance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write, ‘Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.’ ”</p><p>“Yes,” says the Spirit, “that they may rest from their labors, for their works follow with them.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>I looked, and saw a white cloud, and on the cloud one sitting like a son of man,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="rev-14-14-note-1">
