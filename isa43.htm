    <h1>Isaiah</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 43</h2>
    
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>But now the LORD who created you, Jacob,<br/>and he who formed you, Israel, says:<br/>“Don’t be afraid, for I have redeemed you.<br/>I have called you by your name.<br/>You are mine.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>When you pass through the waters, I will be with you,<br/>and through the rivers, they will not overflow you.<br/>When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned,<br/>and flame will not scorch you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For I am the LORD your God,<br/>the Holy One of Israel,<br/>your Savior.<br/>I have given Egypt as your ransom,<br/>Ethiopia and Seba in your place.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Since you have been precious and honored in my sight,<br/>and I have loved you,<br/>therefore I will give people in your place,<br/>and nations instead of your life.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Don’t be afraid, for I am with you.<br/>I will bring your offspring from the east,<br/>and gather you from the west.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>I will tell the north, ‘Give them up!’<br/>and tell the south, ‘Don’t hold them back!<br/>Bring my sons from far away,<br/>and my daughters from the ends of the earth—<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>everyone who is called by my name,<br/>and whom I have created for my glory,<br/>whom I have formed,<br/>yes, whom I have made.’ ”<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Bring out the blind people who have eyes,<br/>and the deaf who have ears.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Let all the nations be gathered together,<br/>and let the peoples be assembled.<br/>Who among them can declare this,<br/>and show us former things?<br/>Let them bring their witnesses, that they may be justified,<br/>or let them hear, and say, “That is true.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>“You are my witnesses,” says the LORD,<br/>“With my servant whom I have chosen;<br/>that you may know and believe me,<br/>and understand that I am he.<br/>Before me there was no God formed,<br/>neither will there be after me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>I myself am the LORD.<br/>Besides me, there is no savior.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>I have declared, I have saved, and I have shown,<br/>and there was no strange god among you.<br/>Therefore you are my witnesses”,<br/>says the LORD, “and I am God.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Yes, since the day was, I am he.<br/>There is no one who can deliver out of my hand.<br/>I will work, and who can hinder it?”</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>The LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel says: “For your sake, I have sent to Babylon, and I will bring all of them down as fugitives, even the Chaldeans, in the ships of their rejoicing.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>I am the LORD, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>The LORD, who makes a way in the sea,</p><blockquote><p>and a path in the mighty waters,<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>who brings out the chariot and horse,<br/>the army and the mighty man<br/>(they lie down together, they shall not rise;<br/>they are extinct, they are quenched like a wick) says:<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>“Don’t remember the former things,<br/>and don’t consider the things of old.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Behold, I will do a new thing.<br/>It springs out now.<br/>Don’t you know it?<br/>I will even make a way in the wilderness,<br/>and rivers in the desert.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>The animals of the field, the jackals and the ostriches, shall honor me,<br/>because I give water in the wilderness and rivers in the desert,<br/>to give drink to my people, my chosen,<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>the people which I formed for myself,<br/>that they might declare my praise.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Yet you have not called on me, Jacob;<br/>but you have been weary of me, Israel.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>You have not brought me any of your sheep for burnt offerings,<br/>neither have you honored me with your sacrifices.<br/>I have not burdened you with offerings,<br/>nor wearied you with frankincense.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>You have bought me no sweet cane with money,<br/>nor have you filled me with the fat of your sacrifices,<br/>but you have burdened me with your sins.<br/>You have wearied me with your iniquities.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions for my own sake;<br/>and I will not remember your sins.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>Put me in remembrance.<br/>Let us plead together.<br/>Declare your case,<br/>that you may be justified.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>Your first father sinned,<br/>and your teachers have transgressed against me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>Therefore I will profane the princes of the sanctuary;<br/>and I will make Jacob a curse,<br/>and Israel an insult.”</p></blockquote></section>
