    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>You are righteous, LORD,<br/>when I contend with you;<br/>yet I would like to plead a case with you.<br/>Why does the way of the wicked prosper?<br/>Why are they all at ease who deal very treacherously?<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>You have planted them. Yes, they have taken root.<br/>They grow. Yes, they produce fruit.<br/>You are near in their mouth,<br/>and far from their heart.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>But you, LORD, know me.<br/>You see me, and test my heart toward you.<br/>Pull them out like sheep for the slaughter,<br/>and prepare them for the day of slaughter.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>How long will the land mourn,<br/>and the herbs of the whole country wither?<br/>Because of the wickedness of those who dwell therein,<br/>the animals and birds are consumed;<br/>because they said,<br/>“He won’t see our latter end.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>“If you have run with the footmen,<br/>and they have wearied you,<br/>then how can you contend with horses?<br/>Though in a land of peace you are secure,<br/>yet how will you do in the pride of the Jordan?<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>For even your brothers, and the house of your father,<br/>even they have dealt treacherously with you!<br/>Even they have cried aloud after you!<br/>Don’t believe them,<br/>though they speak beautiful words to you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>“I have forsaken my house.<br/>I have cast off my heritage.<br/>I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>My heritage has become to me as a lion in the forest.<br/>She has uttered her voice against me.<br/>Therefore I have hated her.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Is my heritage to me as a speckled bird of prey?<br/>Are the birds of prey against her all around?<br/>Go, assemble all the animals of the field.<br/>Bring them to devour.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard.<br/>They have trodden my portion under foot.<br/>They have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>They have made it a desolation.<br/>It mourns to me, being desolate.<br/>The whole land is made desolate,<br/>because no one cares.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Destroyers have come on all the bare heights in the wilderness;<br/>for the sword of the LORD devours from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land.<br/>No flesh has peace.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>They have sown wheat,<br/>and have reaped thorns.<br/>They have exhausted themselves,<br/>and profit nothing.<br/>You will be ashamed of your fruits,<br/>because of the LORD’s fierce anger.”</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>The LORD says, “Concerning all my evil neighbors, who touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit: Behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>It will happen that after I have plucked them up, I will return and have compassion on them. I will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>It will happen, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, ‘As the LORD lives;’ even as they taught my people to swear by Baal, then they will be built up in the middle of my people.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>But if they will not hear, then I will pluck up that nation, plucking up and destroying it,” says the LORD.</p></section>
