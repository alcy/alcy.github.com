    <h1>The Proverbs</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 17</h2>
    
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Better is a dry morsel with quietness,<br/>than a house full of feasting with strife.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>A servant who deals wisely will rule over a son who causes shame,<br/>and shall have a part in the inheritance among the brothers.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold,<br/>but the LORD tests the hearts.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>An evildoer heeds wicked lips.<br/>A liar gives ear to a mischievous tongue.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Whoever mocks the poor reproaches his Maker.<br/>He who is glad at calamity shall not be unpunished.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Children’s children are the crown of old men;<br/>the glory of children is their parents.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Excellent speech isn’t fitting for a fool,<br/>much less do lying lips fit a prince.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>A bribe is a precious stone in the eyes of him who gives it;<br/>wherever he turns, he prospers.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>He who covers an offense promotes love;<br/>but he who repeats a matter separates best friends.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>A rebuke enters deeper into one who has understanding<br/>than a hundred lashes into a fool.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>An evil man seeks only rebellion;<br/>therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Let a bear robbed of her cubs meet a man,<br/>rather than a fool in his folly.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Whoever rewards evil for good,<br/>evil shall not depart from his house.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>The beginning of strife is like breaching a dam,<br/>therefore stop contention before quarreling breaks out.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the righteous,<br/>both of them alike are an abomination to the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Why is there money in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom,<br/>since he has no understanding?<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>A friend loves at all times;<br/>and a brother is born for adversity.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>A man void of understanding strikes hands,<br/>and becomes collateral in the presence of his neighbor.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>He who loves disobedience loves strife.<br/>One who builds a high gate seeks destruction.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>One who has a perverse heart doesn’t find prosperity,<br/>and one who has a deceitful tongue falls into trouble.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>He who becomes the father of a fool grieves.<br/>The father of a fool has no joy.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>A cheerful heart makes good medicine,<br/>but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>A wicked man receives a bribe in secret,<br/>to pervert the ways of justice.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Wisdom is before the face of one who has understanding,<br/>but the eyes of a fool wander to the ends of the earth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>A foolish son brings grief to his father,<br/>and bitterness to her who bore him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>Also to punish the righteous is not good,<br/>nor to flog officials for their integrity.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>He who spares his words has knowledge.<br/>He who is even tempered is a man of understanding.<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>Even a fool, when he keeps silent, is counted wise.<br/>When he shuts his lips, he is thought to be discerning.</p></blockquote></section>
