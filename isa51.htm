    <h1>Isaiah</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 51</h2>
    
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>“Listen to me, you who follow after righteousness,<br/>you who seek the LORD.<br/>Look to the rock you were cut from,<br/>and to the quarry you were dug from.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Look to Abraham your father,<br/>and to Sarah who bore you;<br/>for when he was but one I called him,<br/>I blessed him,<br/>and made him many.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For the LORD has comforted Zion.<br/>He has comforted all her waste places,<br/>and has made her wilderness like Eden,<br/>and her desert like the garden of the LORD.<br/>Joy and gladness will be found in them,<br/>thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>“Listen to me, my people;<br/>and hear me, my nation,<br/>for a law will go out from me,<br/>and I will establish my justice for a light to the peoples.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>My righteousness is near.<br/>My salvation has gone out,<br/>and my arms will judge the peoples.<br/>The islands will wait for me,<br/>and they will trust my arm.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Lift up your eyes to the heavens,<br/>and look at the earth beneath;<br/>for the heavens will vanish away like smoke,<br/>and the earth will wear out like a garment.<br/>Its inhabitants will die in the same way,<br/>but my salvation will be forever,<br/>and my righteousness will not be abolished.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>“Listen to me, you who know righteousness,<br/>the people in whose heart is my law.<br/>Don’t fear the reproach of men,<br/>and don’t be dismayed at their insults.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>For the moth will eat them up like a garment,<br/>and the worm will eat them like wool;<br/>but my righteousness will be forever,<br/>and my salvation to all generations.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Awake, awake, put on strength, arm of the LORD!<br/>Awake, as in the days of old,<br/>the generations of ancient times.<br/>Isn’t it you who cut Rahab in pieces,<br/>who pierced the monster?<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Isn’t it you who dried up the sea,<br/>the waters of the great deep;<br/>who made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Those ransomed by the LORD will return,<br/>and come with singing to Zion.<br/>Everlasting joy shall be on their heads.<br/>They will obtain gladness and joy.<br/>Sorrow and sighing shall flee away.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>“I, even I, am he who comforts you.<br/>Who are you, that you are afraid of man who shall die,<br/>and of the son of man who will be made as grass?<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Have you forgotten the LORD your Maker,<br/>who stretched out the heavens,<br/>and laid the foundations of the earth?<br/>Do you live in fear continually all day because of the fury of the oppressor,<br/>when he prepares to destroy?<br/>Where is the fury of the oppressor?<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>The captive exile will speedily be freed.<br/>He will not die and go down into the pit.<br/>His bread won’t fail.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>For I am the LORD your God, who stirs up the sea<br/>so that its waves roar.<br/>the LORD of Armies is his name.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>I have put my words in your mouth<br/>and have covered you in the shadow of my hand,<br/>that I may plant the heavens,<br/>and lay the foundations of the earth,<br/>and tell Zion, ‘You are my people.’ ”<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Awake, awake!<br/>Stand up, Jerusalem,<br/>you who have drunk from the LORD’s hand the cup of his wrath.<br/>You have drunken the bowl of the cup of staggering,<br/>and drained it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>There is no one to guide her among all the sons to whom she has given birth;<br/>and there is no one who takes her by the hand among all the sons whom she has brought up.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>These two things have happened to you—<br/>who will grieve with you?—<br/>desolation and destruction,<br/>and famine and the sword.<br/>How can I comfort you?<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Your sons have fainted.<br/>They lie at the head of all the streets,<br/>like an antelope in a net.<br/>They are full of the LORD’s wrath,<br/>the rebuke of your God.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Therefore now hear this, you afflicted,<br/>and drunken, but not with wine:<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Your Lord GOD,<br/>your God who pleads the cause of his people, says,<br/>“Behold, I have taken out of your hand the cup of staggering,<br/>even the bowl of the cup of my wrath.<br/>You will not drink it any more.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>I will put it into the hand of those who afflict you,<br/>who have said to your soul, ‘Bow down, that we may walk over you;’<br/>and you have laid your back as the ground,<br/>like a street to those who walk over.”</p></blockquote></section>
