Yes, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Isn’t this a burning stick plucked out of the fire?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>He answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, “Take the filthy garments off him.” To him he said, “Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with rich clothing.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>I said, “Let them set a clean turban on his head.”</p><p>So they set a clean turban on his head, and clothed him; and the LORD’s angel was standing by.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>The LORD’s angel solemnly assured Joshua, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>“The LORD of Armies says: ‘If you will walk in my ways, and if you will follow my instructions, then you also shall judge my house, and shall also keep my courts, and I will give you a place of access among these who stand by.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Hear now, Joshua the high priest, you and your fellows who sit before you, for they are men who are a sign; for, behold, I will bring out my servant, the Branch.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua: on one stone are seven eyes; behold, I will engrave its inscription,’ says the LORD of Armies, ‘and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>In that day,’ says the LORD of Armies, ‘you will invite every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.’ ” <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="zec04.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
