For these seven shall rejoice, and shall see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel. These are the LORD’s eyes, which run back and forth through the whole earth.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Then I asked him, “What are these two olive trees on the right side of the lamp stand and on the left side of it?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>I asked him the second time, “What are these two olive branches, which are beside the two golden spouts that pour the golden oil out of themselves?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>He answered me, “Don’t you know what these are?”</p><p>I said, “No, my lord.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Then he said, “These are the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="zec-4-14-note-1">
