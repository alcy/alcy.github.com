    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Now this is the history of the generations of the sons of Noah and of Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Sons were born to them after the flood.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>The sons of Japheth were: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>The sons of Gomer were: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>The sons of Javan were: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Of these were the islands of the nations divided in their lands, everyone after his language, after their families, in their nations.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>The sons of Ham were: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>The sons of Cush were: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah were: Sheba and Dedan.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Cush became the father of Nimrod. He began to be a mighty one in the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>He was a mighty hunter before the LORD. Therefore it is said, “like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the LORD”.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Out of that land he went into Assyria, and built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah,   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>and Resen between Nineveh and the great city Calah.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Mizraim became the father of Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Pathrusim, Casluhim (which the Philistines descended from), and Caphtorim.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Canaan became the father of Sidon (his firstborn), Heth,   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites,   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites,   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Afterward the families of the Canaanites were spread abroad.   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>The border of the Canaanites was from Sidon—as you go toward Gerar—to Gaza—as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim—to Lasha.   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>These are the sons of Ham, after their families, according to their languages, in their lands and their nations.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Children were also born to Shem (the elder brother of Japheth), the father of all the children of Eber.   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>The sons of Shem were: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>The sons of Aram were: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Arpachshad became the father of Shelah. Shelah became the father of Eber.   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>To Eber were born two sons. The name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided. His brother’s name was Joktan.   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>Joktan became the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,   <span class="verse" id="V27"></span>Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,   <span class="verse" id="V28"></span>Obal, Abimael, Sheba,   <span class="verse" id="V29"></span>Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Joktan.   <span class="verse" id="V30"></span>Their dwelling extended from Mesha, as you go toward Sephar, the mountain of the east.   <span class="verse" id="V31"></span>These are the sons of Shem, by their families, according to their languages, lands, and nations.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V32"></span>These are the families of the sons of Noah, by their generations, according to their nations. The nations divided from these in the earth after the flood.</p></section>
