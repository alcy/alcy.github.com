He may turn and relent,<br/>and leave a blessing behind him,<br/>even a meal offering and a drink offering to the LORD, your God.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Blow the trumpet in Zion!<br/>Sanctify a fast.<br/>Call a solemn assembly.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Gather the people.<br/>Sanctify the assembly.<br/>Assemble the elders.<br/>Gather the children, and those who nurse from breasts.<br/>Let the bridegroom go out of his room,<br/>and the bride out of her chamber.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar,<br/>and let them say, “Spare your people, LORD,<br/>and don’t give your heritage to reproach,<br/>that the nations should rule over them.<br/>Why should they say among the peoples,<br/>‘Where is their God?’ ”<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Then the LORD was jealous for his land,<br/>and had pity on his people.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>The LORD answered his people,<br/>“Behold,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="jol-2-19-note-1">
