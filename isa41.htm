    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>“Keep silent before me, islands,<br/>and let the peoples renew their strength.<br/>Let them come near,<br/>then let them speak.<br/>Let’s meet together for judgment.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Who has raised up one from the east?<br/>Who called him to his feet in righteousness?<br/>He hands over nations to him<br/>and makes him rule over kings.<br/>He gives them like the dust to his sword,<br/>like the driven stubble to his bow.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>He pursues them<br/>and passes by safely,<br/>even by a way that he had not gone with his feet.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Who has worked and done it,<br/>calling the generations from the beginning?<br/>I, the LORD, the first, and with the last, I am he.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>The islands have seen, and fear.<br/>The ends of the earth tremble.<br/>They approach, and come.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Everyone helps his neighbor.<br/>They say to their brothers, “Be strong!”<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>So the carpenter encourages the goldsmith.<br/>He who smooths with the hammer encourages him who strikes the anvil,<br/>saying of the soldering, “It is good;”<br/>and he fastens it with nails, that it might not totter.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>“But you, Israel, my servant,<br/>Jacob whom I have chosen,<br/>the offspring of Abraham my friend,<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>you whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth,<br/>and called from its corners,<br/>and said to you, ‘You are my servant. I have chosen you and have not cast you away.’<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Don’t you be afraid, for I am with you.<br/>Don’t be dismayed, for I am your God.<br/>I will strengthen you.<br/>Yes, I will help you.<br/>Yes, I will uphold you with the right hand of my righteousness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Behold, all those who are incensed against you will be disappointed and confounded.<br/>Those who strive with you will be like nothing, and shall perish.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>You will seek them, and won’t find them,<br/>even those who contend with you.<br/>Those who war against you will be as nothing,<br/>as a nonexistent thing.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>For I, the LORD your God, will hold your right hand,<br/>saying to you, ‘Don’t be afraid.<br/>I will help you.’<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Don’t be afraid, you worm Jacob,<br/>and you men of Israel.<br/>I will help you,” says the LORD.<br/>“Your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Behold, I have made you into a new sharp threshing instrument with teeth.<br/>You will thresh the mountains,<br/>and beat them small,<br/>and will make the hills like chaff.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>You will winnow them,<br/>and the wind will carry them away,<br/>and the whirlwind will scatter them.<br/>You will rejoice in the LORD.<br/>You will glory in the Holy One of Israel.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>The poor and needy seek water, and there is none.<br/>Their tongue fails for thirst.<br/>I, the LORD, will answer them.<br/>I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>I will open rivers on the bare heights,<br/>and springs in the middle of the valleys.<br/>I will make the wilderness a pool of water,<br/>and the dry land springs of water.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>I will put cedar, acacia, myrtle, and oil trees in the wilderness.<br/>I will set cypress trees, pine, and box trees together in the desert;<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>that they may see, know, consider, and understand together,<br/>that the LORD’s hand has done this,<br/>and the Holy One of Israel has created it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Produce your cause,” says the LORD.<br/>“Bring out your strong reasons!” says the King of Jacob.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>“Let them announce and declare to us what will happen!<br/>Declare the former things, what they are,<br/>that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them;<br/>or show us things to come.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Declare the things that are to come hereafter,<br/>that we may know that you are gods.<br/>Yes, do good, or do evil,<br/>that we may be dismayed,<br/>and see it together.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Behold, you are nothing,<br/>and your work is nothing.<br/>He who chooses you is an abomination.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>“I have raised up one from the north, and he has come,<br/>from the rising of the sun, one who calls on my name,<br/>and he shall come on rulers as on mortar,<br/>and as the potter treads clay.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>Who has declared it from the beginning, that we may know?<br/>and before, that we may say, ‘He is right’?<br/>Surely, there is no one who declares.<br/>Surely, there is no one who shows.<br/>Surely, there is no one who hears your words.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>I am the first to say to Zion, ‘Behold, look at them;’<br/>and I will give one who brings good news to Jerusalem.<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>When I look, there is no man,<br/>even among them there is no counselor who, when I ask, can answer a word.<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>Behold, all of their deeds are vanity and nothing.<br/>Their molten images are wind and confusion.</p></blockquote></section>
