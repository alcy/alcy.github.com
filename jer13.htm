It was profitable for nothing.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Then the LORD’s word came to me, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>“The LORD says, ‘In this way I will ruin the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who walk in the stubbornness of their heart, and have gone after other gods to serve them and to worship them, will even be as this belt, which is profitable for nothing.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>For as the belt clings to the waist of a man, so I have caused the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah to cling to me,’ says the LORD; ‘that they may be to me for a people, for a name, for praise, and for glory; but they would not hear.’</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>“Therefore you shall speak to them this word: ‘The LORD, the God of Israel says, “Every container should be filled with wine.” ’ They will tell you, ‘Do we not certainly know that every container should be filled with wine?’   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Then tell them, ‘The LORD says, “Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings who sit on David’s throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together,” says the LORD: “I will not pity, spare, or have compassion, that I should not destroy them.” ’ ”</p><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Hear, and give ear.<br/>Don’t be proud,<br/>for the LORD has spoken.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Give glory to the LORD your God,<br/>before he causes darkness,<br/>and before your feet stumble on the dark mountains,<br/>and while you look for light,<br/>he turns it into the shadow of death,<br/>and makes it deep darkness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>But if you will not hear it,<br/>my soul will weep in secret for your pride.<br/>My eye will weep bitterly,<br/>and run down with tears,<br/>because the LORD’s flock has been taken captive.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Say to the king and to the queen mother,<br/>“Humble yourselves.<br/>Sit down, for your crowns have come down,<br/>even the crown of your glory.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>The cities of the South are shut up,<br/>and there is no one to open them.<br/>Judah is carried away captive: all of them.<br/>They are wholly carried away captive.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Lift up your eyes,<br/>and see those who come from the north.<br/>Where is the flock that was given to you,<br/>your beautiful flock?<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>What will you say when he sets over you as head those whom you have yourself taught to be friends to you?<br/>Won’t sorrows take hold of you, as of a woman in travail?<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>If you say in your heart,<br/>“Why have these things come on me?”<br/>Your skirts are uncovered because of the greatness of your iniquity,<br/>and your heels suffer violence.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Can the Ethiopian change his skin,<br/>or the leopard his spots?<br/>Then may you also do good,<br/>who are accustomed to do evil.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>“Therefore I will scatter them<br/>as the stubble that passes away<br/>by the wind of the wilderness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>This is your lot,<br/>the portion measured to you from me,” says the LORD,<br/>“because you have forgotten me,<br/>and trusted in falsehood.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>Therefore I will also uncover your skirts on your face,<br/>and your shame will appear.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>I have seen your abominations, even your adulteries<br/>and your neighing, the lewdness of your prostitution,<br/>on the hills in the field.<br/>Woe to you, Jerusalem!<br/>You will not be made clean.<br/>How long will it yet be?” <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="jer14.htm">→</a></span></p></blockquote></section>
