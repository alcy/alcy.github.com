    <h2>Chapter 20</h2>
    
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Wine is a mocker and beer is a brawler.<br/>Whoever is led astray by them is not wise.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>The terror of a king is like the roaring of a lion.<br/>He who provokes him to anger forfeits his own life.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife,<br/>but every fool will be quarreling.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>The sluggard will not plow by reason of the winter;<br/>therefore he shall beg in harvest, and have nothing.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water,<br/>but a man of understanding will draw it out.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Many men claim to be men of unfailing love,<br/>but who can find a faithful man?<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>A righteous man walks in integrity.<br/>Blessed are his children after him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>A king who sits on the throne of judgment<br/>scatters away all evil with his eyes.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Who can say, “I have made my heart pure.<br/>I am clean and without sin”?<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Differing weights and differing measures,<br/>both of them alike are an abomination to the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Even a child makes himself known by his doings,<br/>whether his work is pure, and whether it is right.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>The hearing ear, and the seeing eye,<br/>the LORD has made even both of them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Don’t love sleep, lest you come to poverty.<br/>Open your eyes, and you shall be satisfied with bread.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>“It’s no good, it’s no good,” says the buyer;<br/>but when he is gone his way, then he boasts.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>There is gold and abundance of rubies,<br/>but the lips of knowledge are a rare jewel.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Take the garment of one who puts up collateral for a stranger;<br/>and hold him in pledge for a wayward woman.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Fraudulent food is sweet to a man,<br/>but afterwards his mouth is filled with gravel.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Plans are established by advice;<br/>by wise guidance you wage war!<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>He who goes about as a tale-bearer reveals secrets;<br/>therefore don’t keep company with him who opens wide his lips.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Whoever curses his father or his mother,<br/>his lamp shall be put out in blackness of darkness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>An inheritance quickly gained at the beginning<br/>won’t be blessed in the end.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Don’t say, “I will pay back evil.”<br/>Wait for the LORD, and he will save you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>The LORD detests differing weights,<br/>and dishonest scales are not pleasing.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>A man’s steps are from the LORD;<br/>how then can man understand his way?<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>It is a snare to a man to make a rash dedication,<br/>then later to consider his vows.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>A wise king winnows out the wicked,<br/>and drives the threshing wheel over them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>The spirit of man is the LORD’s lamp,<br/>searching all his innermost parts.<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>Love and faithfulness keep the king safe.<br/>His throne is sustained by love.<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>The glory of young men is their strength.<br/>The splendor of old men is their gray hair.<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>Wounding blows cleanse away evil,<br/>and beatings purge the innermost parts. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="pro21.htm">→</a></span></p></blockquote></section>
