    <h1>Psalm 10</h1>

    
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Why do you stand far off, LORD?<br/>Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>In arrogance, the wicked hunt down the weak.<br/>They are caught in the schemes that they devise.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For the wicked boasts of his heart’s cravings.<br/>He blesses the greedy and condemns the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>The wicked, in the pride of his face,<br/>has no room in his thoughts for God.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>His ways are prosperous at all times.<br/>He is arrogant, and your laws are far from his sight.<br/>As for all his adversaries, he sneers at them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>He says in his heart, “I shall not be shaken.<br/>For generations I shall have no trouble.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression.<br/>Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>He lies in wait near the villages.<br/>From ambushes, he murders the innocent.<br/>His eyes are secretly set against the helpless.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>He lurks in secret as a lion in his ambush.<br/>He lies in wait to catch the helpless.<br/>He catches the helpless when he draws him in his net.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>The helpless are crushed.<br/>They collapse.<br/>They fall under his strength.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>He says in his heart, “God has forgotten.<br/>He hides his face.<br/>He will never see it.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Arise, LORD!<br/>God, lift up your hand!<br/>Don’t forget the helpless.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Why does the wicked person condemn God,<br/>and say in his heart, “God won’t call me into account”?<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>But you do see trouble and grief.<br/>You consider it to take it into your hand.<br/>You help the victim and the fatherless.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Break the arm of the wicked.<br/>As for the evil man, seek out his wickedness until you find none.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>The LORD is King forever and ever!<br/>The nations will perish out of his land.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>LORD, you have heard the desire of the humble.<br/>You will prepare their heart.<br/>You will cause your ear to hear,<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>to judge the fatherless and the oppressed,<br/>that man who is of the earth may terrify no more.</p></blockquote></section>
