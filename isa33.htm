    <h2>Chapter 33</h2>
    
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Woe to you who destroy, but you weren’t destroyed,<br/>and who betray, but nobody betrayed you!<br/>When you have finished destroying, you will be destroyed;<br/>and when you have finished betrayal, you will be betrayed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>LORD, be gracious to us. We have waited for you.<br/>Be our strength every morning,<br/>our salvation also in the time of trouble.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>At the noise of the thunder, the peoples have fled.<br/>When you lift yourself up, the nations are scattered.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Your plunder will be gathered as the caterpillar gathers.<br/>Men will leap on it as locusts leap.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>The LORD is exalted, for he dwells on high.<br/>He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>There will be stability in your times, abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge.<br/>The fear of the LORD is your treasure.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Behold, their valiant ones cry outside;<br/>the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>The highways are desolate.<br/>The traveling man ceases.<br/>The covenant is broken.<br/>He has despised the cities.<br/>He doesn’t respect man.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>The land mourns and languishes.<br/>Lebanon is confounded and withers away.<br/>Sharon is like a desert, and Bashan and Carmel are stripped bare.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>“Now I will arise,” says the LORD.<br/>“Now I will lift myself up.<br/>Now I will be exalted.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>You will conceive chaff.<br/>You will give birth to stubble.<br/>Your breath is a fire that will devour you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>The peoples will be like the burning of lime,<br/>like thorns that are cut down and burned in the fire.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Hear, you who are far off, what I have done;<br/>and, you who are near, acknowledge my might.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>The sinners in Zion are afraid.<br/>Trembling has seized the godless ones.<br/>Who among us can live with the devouring fire?<br/>Who among us can live with everlasting burning?<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>He who walks righteously<br/>and speaks blamelessly,<br/>he who despises the gain of oppressions,<br/>who gestures with his hands, refusing to take a bribe,<br/>who stops his ears from hearing of bloodshed,<br/>and shuts his eyes from looking at evil—<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>he will dwell on high.<br/>His place of defense will be the fortress of rocks.<br/>His bread will be supplied.<br/>His waters will be sure.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Your eyes will see the king in his beauty.<br/>They will see a distant land.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Your heart will meditate on the terror.<br/>Where is he who counted?<br/>Where is he who weighed?<br/>Where is he who counted the towers?<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>You will no longer see the fierce people,<br/>a people of a deep speech that you can’t comprehend,<br/>with a strange language that you can’t understand.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Look at Zion, the city of our appointed festivals.<br/>Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a quiet habitation,<br/>a tent that won’t be removed.<br/>Its stakes will never be plucked up,<br/>nor will any of its cords be broken.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>But there the LORD will be with us in majesty,<br/>a place of wide rivers and streams,<br/>in which no galley with oars will go,<br/>neither will any gallant ship pass by there.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>For the LORD is our judge.<br/>The LORD is our lawgiver.<br/>The LORD is our king.<br/>He will save us.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Your rigging is untied.<br/>They couldn’t strengthen the foot of their mast.<br/>They couldn’t spread the sail.<br/>Then the prey of a great plunder was divided.<br/>The lame took the prey.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>The inhabitant won’t say, “I am sick.”<br/>The people who dwell therein will be forgiven their iniquity.</p></blockquote></section>
