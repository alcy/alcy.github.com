From there, when his father was dead, God moved him into this land where you are now living.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>He gave him no inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on. He promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his offspring after him, when he still had no child.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>God spoke in this way: that his offspring would live as aliens in a strange land, and that they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>‘I will judge the nation to which they will be in bondage,’ said God, ‘and after that they will come out and serve me in this place.’<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="act-7-7-note-1">

Our fathers found no food.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers the first time.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>On the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers, and Joseph’s family was revealed to Pharaoh.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Joseph sent and summoned Jacob his father and all his relatives, seventy-five souls.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Jacob went down into Egypt and he died, himself and our fathers;   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>and they were brought back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver from the children of Hamor of Shechem.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>“But as the time of the promise came close which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>until there arose a different king who didn’t know Joseph.   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>The same took advantage of our race and mistreated our fathers, and forced them to abandon their babies, so that they wouldn’t stay alive.   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>At that time Moses was born, and was exceedingly handsome to God.
