    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Misery is mine!<br/>Indeed, I am like one who gathers the summer fruits, as gleanings of the vineyard.<br/>There is no cluster of grapes to eat.<br/>My soul desires to eat the early fig.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>The godly man has perished out of the earth,<br/>and there is no one upright among men.<br/>They all lie in wait for blood;<br/>every man hunts his brother with a net.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Their hands are on that which is evil to do it diligently.<br/>The ruler and judge ask for a bribe.<br/>The powerful man dictates the evil desire of his soul.<br/>Thus they conspire together.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>The best of them is like a brier.<br/>The most upright is worse than a thorn hedge.<br/>The day of your watchmen,<br/>even your visitation, has come;<br/>now is the time of their confusion.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Don’t trust in a neighbor.<br/>Don’t put confidence in a friend.<br/>With the woman lying in your embrace,<br/>be careful of the words of your mouth!<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>For the son dishonors the father,<br/>the daughter rises up against her mother,<br/>the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;<br/>a man’s enemies are the men of his own house.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>But as for me, I will look to the LORD.<br/>I will wait for the God of my salvation.<br/>My God will hear me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Don’t rejoice against me, my enemy.<br/>When I fall, I will arise.<br/>When I sit in darkness, the LORD will be a light to me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>I will bear the indignation of the LORD,<br/>because I have sinned against him,<br/>until he pleads my case and executes judgment for me.<br/>He will bring me out to the light.<br/>I will see his righteousness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Then my enemy will see it,<br/>and shame will cover her who said to me,<br/>“Where is the LORD your God?”<br/>My eyes will see her.<br/>Now she will be trodden down like the mire of the streets.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>A day to build your walls!<br/>In that day, he will extend your boundary.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>In that day they will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt,<br/>and from Egypt even to the River,<br/>and from sea to sea,<br/>and mountain to mountain.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Yet the land will be desolate because of those who dwell therein,<br/>for the fruit of their doings.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Shepherd your people with your staff,<br/>the flock of your heritage,<br/>who dwell by themselves in a forest.<br/>Let them feed in the middle of fertile pasture land,<br/>in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>“As in the days of your coming out of the land of Egypt,<br/>I will show them marvelous things.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>The nations will see and be ashamed of all their might.<br/>They will lay their hand on their mouth.<br/>Their ears will be deaf.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>They will lick the dust like a serpent.<br/>Like crawling things of the earth, they will come trembling out of their dens.<br/>They will come with fear to the LORD our God,<br/>and will be afraid because of you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Who is a God like you, who pardons iniquity,<br/>and passes over the disobedience of the remnant of his heritage?<br/>He doesn’t retain his anger forever,<br/>because he delights in loving kindness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>He will again have compassion on us.<br/>He will tread our iniquities under foot.<br/>You will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>You will give truth to Jacob,<br/>and mercy to Abraham,<br/>as you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.</p></blockquote></section>
