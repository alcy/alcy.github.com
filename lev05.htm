He shall wring off its head from its neck, but shall not sever it completely.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>He shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar. It is a sin offering.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>He shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to the ordinance; and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin which he has sinned, and he shall be forgiven.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>“ ‘But if he can’t afford two turtledoves or two young pigeons, then he shall bring as his offering for that in which he has sinned, one tenth of an ephah<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="lev-5-11-note-1">
