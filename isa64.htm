    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Oh that you would tear the heavens,<br/>that you would come down,<br/>that the mountains might quake at your presence—<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>as when fire kindles the brushwood,<br/>and the fire causes the water to boil.<br/>Make your name known to your adversaries,<br/>that the nations may tremble at your presence!<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>When you did awesome things which we didn’t look for,<br/>you came down, and the mountains quaked at your presence.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>For from of old men have not heard,<br/>nor perceived by the ear,<br/>nor has the eye seen a God besides you,<br/>who works for him who waits for him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>You meet him who rejoices and does righteousness,<br/>those who remember you in your ways.<br/>Behold, you were angry, and we sinned.<br/>We have been in sin for a long time.<br/>Shall we be saved?<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>For we have all become like one who is unclean,<br/>and all our righteousness is like a polluted garment.<br/>We all fade like a leaf;<br/>and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>There is no one who calls on your name,<br/>who stirs himself up to take hold of you;<br/>for you have hidden your face from us,<br/>and have consumed us by means of our iniquities.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>But now, LORD, you are our Father.<br/>We are the clay and you our potter.<br/>We all are the work of your hand.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Don’t be furious, LORD.<br/>Don’t remember iniquity forever.<br/>Look and see, we beg you,<br/>we are all your people.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Your holy cities have become a wilderness.<br/>Zion has become a wilderness,<br/>Jerusalem a desolation.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Our holy and our beautiful house where our fathers praised you<br/>is burned with fire.<br/>All our pleasant places are laid waste.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Will you hold yourself back for these things, LORD?<br/>Will you keep silent and punish us very severely? <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="isa65.htm">→</a></span></p></blockquote></section>
