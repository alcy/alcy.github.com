    <h1>Psalm 53</h1>

    <p class="psalm-subtitle">For the Chief Musician. To the tune of “Mahalath.” A contemplation by David.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.”<br/>They are corrupt, and have done abominable iniquity.<br/>There is no one who does good.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>God looks down from heaven on the children of men,<br/>to see if there are any who understood,<br/>who seek after God.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Every one of them has gone back.<br/>They have become filthy together.<br/>There is no one who does good, no, not one.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge,<br/>who eat up my people as they eat bread,<br/>and don’t call on God?<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>There they were in great fear, where no fear was,<br/>for God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you.<br/>You have put them to shame,<br/>because God has rejected them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!<br/>When God brings back his people from captivity,<br/>then Jacob shall rejoice,<br/>and Israel shall be glad.</p></blockquote></section>
