For they don’t wash their hands when they eat bread.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>He answered them, <span class="wj">“Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition? </span> <span class="verse" id="V4"></span><span class="wj">For God commanded, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’</span><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="mat-15-4-note-1">

</span></p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>He summoned the multitude, and said to them, <span class="wj">“Hear, and understand. </span> <span class="verse" id="V11"></span><span class="wj">That which enters into the mouth doesn’t defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Then the disciples came and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>But he answered, <span class="wj">“Every plant which my heavenly Father didn’t plant will be uprooted. </span> <span class="verse" id="V14"></span><span class="wj">Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Peter answered him, “Explain the parable to us.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>So Jesus said, <span class="wj">“Do you also still not understand? </span> <span class="verse" id="V17"></span><span class="wj">Don’t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly and then out of the body? </span> <span class="verse" id="V18"></span><span class="wj">But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man. </span> <span class="verse" id="V19"></span><span class="wj">For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies. </span> <span class="verse" id="V20"></span><span class="wj">These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn’t defile the man.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Jesus went out from there and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon.   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders and cried, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, you son of David! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon!”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>But he answered her not a word.</p><p>His disciples came and begged him, saying, “Send her away; for she cries after us.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>But he answered, <span class="wj">“I wasn’t sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>But she came and worshiped him, saying, “Lord, help me.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>But he answered, <span class="wj">“It is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>But she said, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>Then Jesus answered her, <span class="wj">“Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire.”</span> And her daughter was healed from that hour.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>Jesus departed from there and came near to the sea of Galilee; and he went up on the mountain and sat there.   <span class="verse" id="V30"></span>Great multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He healed them,   <span class="verse" id="V31"></span>so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking, the injured healed, the lame walking, and the blind seeing—and they glorified the God of Israel.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V32"></span>Jesus summoned his disciples and said, <span class="wj">“I have compassion on the multitude, because they have continued with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I don’t want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the way.” </span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V33"></span>The disciples said to him, “Where could we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V34"></span>Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“How many loaves do you have?”</span></p><p>They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V35"></span>He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;   <span class="verse" id="V36"></span>and he took the seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.   <span class="verse" id="V37"></span>They all ate and were filled. They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.   <span class="verse" id="V38"></span>Those who ate were four thousand men, in addition to women and children.   <span class="verse" id="V39"></span>Then he sent away the multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="mat16.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
