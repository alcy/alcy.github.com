    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>After these things, Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is also called the Sea of Tiberias.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>A great multitude followed him, because they saw his signs which he did on those who were sick.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Jesus went up into the mountain, and he sat there with his disciples.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Jesus therefore, lifting up his eyes and seeing that a great multitude was coming to him, said to Philip, <span class="wj">“Where are we to buy bread, that these may eat?”</span> <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>He said this to test him, for he himself knew what he would do.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Philip answered him, “Two hundred denarii<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="jhn-6-7-note-1">

        A denarius was a silver coin worth about a day’s wages for an agricultural laborer, so 200 denarii would be between 6 and 7 month’s pay.

So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Jesus took the loaves, and having given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were sitting down, likewise also of the fish as much as they desired.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>When they were filled, he said to his disciples, <span class="wj">“Gather up the broken pieces which are left over, that nothing be lost.”</span> <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which were left over by those who had eaten.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>When therefore the people saw the sign which Jesus did, they said, “This is truly the prophet who comes into the world.”   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Jesus therefore, perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, withdrew again to the mountain by himself.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>They entered into the boat, and were going over the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>The sea was tossed by a great wind blowing.   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>When therefore they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="jhn-6-19-note-1">

</span> <span class="wj">Therefore everyone who hears from the Father and has learned, comes to me. </span> <span class="verse" id="V46"></span><span class="wj">Not that anyone has seen the Father, except he who is from God.

If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. Yes, the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V52"></span>The Jews therefore contended with one another, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V53"></span>Jesus therefore said to them, <span class="wj">“Most certainly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you don’t have life in yourselves. </span> <span class="verse" id="V54"></span><span class="wj">He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. </span> <span class="verse" id="V55"></span><span class="wj">For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. </span> <span class="verse" id="V56"></span><span class="wj">He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me, and I in him. </span> <span class="verse" id="V57"></span><span class="wj">As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so he who feeds on me will also live because of me. </span> <span class="verse" id="V58"></span><span class="wj">This is the bread which came down out of heaven—not as our fathers ate the manna and died. He who eats this bread will live forever.”</span> <span class="verse" id="V59"></span>He said these things in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V60"></span>Therefore many of his disciples, when they heard this, said, “This is a hard saying! Who can listen to it?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V61"></span>But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said to them, <span class="wj">“Does this cause you to stumble? </span> <span class="verse" id="V62"></span><span class="wj">Then what if you would see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? </span> <span class="verse" id="V63"></span><span class="wj">It is the spirit who gives life. The flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and are life. </span> <span class="verse" id="V64"></span><span class="wj">But there are some of you who don’t believe.”</span> For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who didn’t believe, and who it was who would betray him.   <span class="verse" id="V65"></span>He said, <span class="wj">“For this cause I have said to you that no one can come to me, unless it is given to him by my Father.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V66"></span>At this, many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him.   <span class="verse" id="V67"></span>Jesus said therefore to the twelve, <span class="wj">“You don’t also want to go away, do you?”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V68"></span>Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.   <span class="verse" id="V69"></span>We have come to believe and know that you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V70"></span>Jesus answered them, <span class="wj">“Didn’t I choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?”</span> <span class="verse" id="V71"></span>Now he spoke of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for it was he who would betray him, being one of the twelve.</p></section>
