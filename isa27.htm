    <h1>Isaiah</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 27</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>In that day, the LORD with his hard and great and strong sword will punish leviathan, the fleeing serpent, and leviathan, the twisted serpent; and he will kill the dragon that is in the sea.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>In that day, sing to her, “A pleasant vineyard!   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>I, the LORD, am its keeper. I will water it every moment. Lest anyone damage it, I will keep it night and day.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Wrath is not in me, but if I should find briers and thorns, I would do battle! I would march on them and I would burn them together.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Or else let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me. Let him make peace with me.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>In days to come, Jacob will take root. Israel will blossom and bud. They will fill the surface of the world with fruit.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Has he struck them as he struck those who struck them? Or are they killed like those who killed them were killed?   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>In measure, when you send them away, you contend with them. He has removed them with his rough blast in the day of the east wind.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Therefore by this the iniquity of Jacob will be forgiven, and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin: that he makes all the stones of the altar as chalk stones that are beaten in pieces, so that the Asherah poles and the incense altars shall rise no more.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness. The calf will feed there, and there he will lie down, and consume its branches.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>When its boughs are withered, they will be broken off. The women will come and set them on fire, for they are a people of no understanding. Therefore he who made them will not have compassion on them, and he who formed them will show them no favor.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>It will happen in that day that the LORD will thresh from the flowing stream of the Euphrates to the brook of Egypt; and you will be gathered one by one, children of Israel.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>It will happen in that day that a great trumpet will be blown; and those who were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and those who were outcasts in the land of Egypt, shall come; and they will worship the LORD in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.</p></section>
