    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>The plans of the heart belong to man,<br/>but the answer of the tongue is from the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes,<br/>but the LORD weighs the motives.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Commit your deeds to the LORD,<br/>and your plans shall succeed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>The LORD has made everything for its own end—<br/>yes, even the wicked for the day of evil.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD;<br/>they shall certainly not be unpunished.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>By mercy and truth iniquity is atoned for.<br/>By the fear of the LORD men depart from evil.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>When a man’s ways please the LORD,<br/>he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Better is a little with righteousness,<br/>than great revenues with injustice.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>A man’s heart plans his course,<br/>but the LORD directs his steps.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Inspired judgments are on the lips of the king.<br/>He shall not betray his mouth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Honest balances and scales are the LORD’s;<br/>all the weights in the bag are his work.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>It is an abomination for kings to do wrong,<br/>for the throne is established by righteousness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Righteous lips are the delight of kings.<br/>They value one who speaks the truth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>The king’s wrath is a messenger of death,<br/>but a wise man will pacify it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>In the light of the king’s face is life.<br/>His favor is like a cloud of the spring rain.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>How much better it is to get wisdom than gold!<br/>Yes, to get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>The highway of the upright is to depart from evil.<br/>He who keeps his way preserves his soul.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Pride goes before destruction,<br/>and an arrogant spirit before a fall.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor,<br/>than to divide the plunder with the proud.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>He who heeds the Word finds prosperity.<br/>Whoever trusts in the LORD is blessed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>The wise in heart shall be called prudent.<br/>Pleasantness of the lips promotes instruction.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Understanding is a fountain of life to one who has it,<br/>but the punishment of fools is their folly.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>The heart of the wise instructs his mouth,<br/>and adds learning to his lips.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Pleasant words are a honeycomb,<br/>sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>There is a way which seems right to a man,<br/>but in the end it leads to death.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>The appetite of the laboring man labors for him,<br/>for his mouth urges him on.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>A worthless man devises mischief.<br/>His speech is like a scorching fire.<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>A perverse man stirs up strife.<br/>A whisperer separates close friends.<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>A man of violence entices his neighbor,<br/>and leads him in a way that is not good.<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>One who winks his eyes to plot perversities,<br/>one who compresses his lips, is bent on evil.<br/><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>Gray hair is a crown of glory.<br/>It is attained by a life of righteousness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V32"></span>One who is slow to anger is better than the mighty;<br/>one who rules his spirit, than he who takes a city.<br/><span class="verse" id="V33"></span>The lot is cast into the lap,<br/>but its every decision is from the LORD.</p></blockquote></section>
