    <h1>Psalm 49</h1>

    <p class="psalm-subtitle">For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by the sons of Korah.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Hear this, all you peoples.<br/>Listen, all you inhabitants of the world,<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>both low and high,<br/>rich and poor together.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>My mouth will speak words of wisdom.<br/>My heart will utter understanding.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>I will incline my ear to a proverb.<br/>I will solve my riddle on the harp.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Why should I fear in the days of evil,<br/>when iniquity at my heels surrounds me?<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Those who trust in their wealth,<br/>and boast in the multitude of their riches—<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>none of them can by any means redeem his brother,<br/>nor give God a ransom for him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>For the redemption of their life is costly,<br/>no payment is ever enough,<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>that he should live on forever,<br/>that he should not see corruption.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>For he sees that wise men die;<br/>likewise the fool and the senseless perish,<br/>and leave their wealth to others.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Their inward thought is that their houses will endure forever,<br/>and their dwelling places to all generations.<br/>They name their lands after themselves.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>But man, despite his riches, doesn’t endure.<br/>He is like the animals that perish.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>This is the destiny of those who are foolish,<br/>and of those who approve their sayings.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>They are appointed as a flock for Sheol.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="psa-49-14-note-1">

<input class="margin-toggle" id="psa-49-14-note-1" type="checkbox"/>
<span class="sidenote">
            Sheol is the place of the dead.
            </span><br/>Death shall be their shepherd.<br/>The upright shall have dominion over them in the morning.<br/>Their beauty shall decay in Sheol,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="psa-49-14-note-2">

            Sheol is the place of the dead.
            </span><br/>far from their mansion.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="psa-49-15-note-1">

            </span><br/>for he will receive me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Don’t be afraid when a man is made rich,<br/>when the glory of his house is increased;<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>for when he dies he will carry nothing away.<br/>His glory won’t descend after him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Though while he lived he blessed his soul—<br/>and men praise you when you do well for yourself—<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>he shall go to the generation of his fathers.<br/>They shall never see the light.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>A man who has riches without understanding,<br/>is like the animals that perish.</p></blockquote></section>
