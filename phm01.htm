        “Christ” means “Anointed One”.
        </span> Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house:   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>hearing of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>that the fellowship of your faith may become effective in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Therefore though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate,   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>yet for love’s sake I rather appeal to you, being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>I appeal to you for my child Onesimus, whom I have become the father of in my chains,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="phm-1-10-note-1">

<span class="sidenote">
        Onesimus means “useful”.
        </span> <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>I am sending him back. Therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while that you would have him forever,   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother—especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>But if he has wronged you at all or owes you anything, put that to my account.   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides).   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p></section>
