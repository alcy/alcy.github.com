        NU reads Christ Jesus and omits the Lord.
        </span> our hope,   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>to Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>As I urged you when I was going into Macedonia, stay at Ephesus that you might command certain men not to teach a different doctrine,   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>and not to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which cause disputes rather than God’s stewardship, which is in faith.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>But the goal of this command is love from a pure heart, a good conscience, and sincere faith,   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>from which things some, having missed the mark, have turned away to vain talking,   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say nor about what they strongly affirm.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>But we know that the law is good if a person uses it lawfully,   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>for the sexually immoral, for homosexuals, for slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and for any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine,   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>according to the Good News of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>I thank him who enabled me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he counted me faithful, appointing me to service,   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>although I used to be a blasphemer, a persecutor, and insolent. However, I obtained mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>The saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus Christ might display all his patience for an example of those who were going to believe in him for eternal life.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>I commit this instruction to you, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which were given to you before, that by them you may wage the good warfare,   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>holding faith and a good conscience, which some having thrust away made a shipwreck concerning the faith,   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I delivered to Satan that they might be taught not to blaspheme.</p></section>
