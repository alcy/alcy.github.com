    <h1>Matthew</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 22</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Jesus answered and spoke to them again in parables, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span><span class="wj">“The Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king, who made a wedding feast for his son, </span> <span class="verse" id="V3"></span><span class="wj">and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come. </span> <span class="verse" id="V4"></span><span class="wj">Again he sent out other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who are invited, “Behold, I have prepared my dinner. My cattle and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding feast!” ’ </span> <span class="verse" id="V5"></span><span class="wj">But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise; </span> <span class="verse" id="V6"></span><span class="wj">and the rest grabbed his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them. </span> <span class="verse" id="V7"></span><span class="wj">When the king heard that, he was angry, and sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V8"></span><span class="wj">“Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding is ready, but those who were invited weren’t worthy. </span> <span class="verse" id="V9"></span><span class="wj">Go therefore to the intersections of the highways, and as many as you may find, invite to the wedding feast.’ </span> <span class="verse" id="V10"></span><span class="wj">Those servants went out into the highways and gathered together as many as they found, both bad and good. The wedding was filled with guests. </span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span><span class="wj">“But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who didn’t have on wedding clothing, </span> <span class="verse" id="V12"></span><span class="wj">and he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you come in here not wearing wedding clothing?’ He was speechless. </span> <span class="verse" id="V13"></span><span class="wj">Then the king said to the servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and throw him into the outer darkness. That is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be.’ </span> <span class="verse" id="V14"></span><span class="wj">For many are called, but few chosen.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might entrap him in his talk.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are honest, and teach the way of God in truth, no matter whom you teach; for you aren’t partial to anyone.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Tell us therefore, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, <span class="wj">“Why do you test me, you hypocrites? </span> <span class="verse" id="V19"></span><span class="wj">Show me the tax money.”</span></p><p>They brought to him a denarius.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>He asked them, <span class="wj">“Whose is this image and inscription?”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>They said to him, “Caesar’s.”</p><p>Then he said to them, <span class="wj">“Give therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>When they heard it, they marveled, and left him and went away.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>On that day Sadducees (those who say that there is no resurrection) came to him. They asked him,   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>saying, “Teacher, Moses said, ‘If a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up offspring<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="mat-22-24-note-1">

        or, seed
        </span> for his brother.’   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>Now there were with us seven brothers. The first married and died, and having no offspring left his wife to his brother.   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>In the same way, the second also, and the third, to the seventh.   <span class="verse" id="V27"></span>After them all, the woman died.   <span class="verse" id="V28"></span>In the resurrection therefore, whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had her.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>But Jesus answered them, <span class="wj">“You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God. </span> <span class="verse" id="V30"></span><span class="wj">For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like God’s angels in heaven. </span> <span class="verse" id="V31"></span><span class="wj">But concerning the resurrection of the dead, haven’t you read that which was spoken to you by God, saying, </span> <span class="verse" id="V32"></span><span class="wj">‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?</span><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="mat-22-32-note-1">
