These all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus!”   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>The multitude and the rulers of the city were troubled when they heard these things.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>When they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea. When they arrived, they went into the Jewish synagogue.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Many of them therefore believed; also of the prominent Greek women, and not a few men.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Beroea also, they came there likewise, agitating the multitudes.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Then the brothers immediately sent out Paul to go as far as to the sea, and Silas and Timothy still stayed there.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>But those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens. Receiving a commandment to Silas and Timothy that they should come to him very quickly, they departed.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw the city full of idols.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with those who met him.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="act-17-18-note-1">

Some said, “What does this babbler want to say?”</p><p>Others said, “He seems to be advocating foreign deities,” because he preached Jesus and the resurrection.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>They took hold of him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, “May we know what this new teaching is, which you are speaking about?   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>For you bring certain strange things to our ears. We want to know therefore what these things mean.”   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Now all the Athenians and the strangers living there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Paul stood in the middle of the Areopagus and said, “You men of Athens, I perceive that you are very religious in all things.   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>For as I passed along and observed the objects of your worship, I also found an altar with this inscription: ‘TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.’ What therefore you worship in ignorance, I announce to you.   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>The God who made the world and all things in it, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, doesn’t dwell in temples made with hands.   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>He isn’t served by men’s hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he himself gives to all life and breath and all things.   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>He made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the surface of the earth, having determined appointed seasons and the boundaries of their dwellings,   <span class="verse" id="V27"></span>that they should seek the Lord, if perhaps they might reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us.   <span class="verse" id="V28"></span>‘For in him we live, move, and have our being.’ As some of your own poets have said, ‘For we are also his offspring.’   <span class="verse" id="V29"></span>Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold, or silver, or stone, engraved by art and design of man.   <span class="verse" id="V30"></span>The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked. But now he commands that all people everywhere should repent,   <span class="verse" id="V31"></span>because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained; of which he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V32"></span>Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, “We want to hear you again concerning this.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V33"></span>Thus Paul went out from among them.   <span class="verse" id="V34"></span>But certain men joined with him and believed, including Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="act18.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
