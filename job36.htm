    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Elihu also continued, and said,</p><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>“Bear with me a little, and I will show you;<br/>for I still have something to say on God’s behalf.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>I will get my knowledge from afar,<br/>and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>For truly my words are not false.<br/>One who is perfect in knowledge is with you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>“Behold, God is mighty, and doesn’t despise anyone.<br/>He is mighty in strength of understanding.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>He doesn’t preserve the life of the wicked,<br/>but gives justice to the afflicted.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>He doesn’t withdraw his eyes from the righteous,<br/>but with kings on the throne,<br/>he sets them forever, and they are exalted.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>If they are bound in fetters,<br/>and are taken in the cords of afflictions,<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>then he shows them their work,<br/>and their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>He also opens their ears to instruction,<br/>and commands that they return from iniquity.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>If they listen and serve him,<br/>they will spend their days in prosperity,<br/>and their years in pleasures.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>But if they don’t listen, they will perish by the sword;<br/>they will die without knowledge.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>“But those who are godless in heart lay up anger.<br/>They don’t cry for help when he binds them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>They die in youth.<br/>Their life perishes among the unclean.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>He delivers the afflicted by their affliction,<br/>and opens their ear in oppression.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Yes, he would have allured you out of distress,<br/>into a wide place, where there is no restriction.<br/>That which is set on your table would be full of fatness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>“But you are full of the judgment of the wicked.<br/>Judgment and justice take hold of you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Don’t let riches entice you to wrath,<br/>neither let the great size of a bribe turn you aside.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Would your wealth sustain you in distress,<br/>or all the might of your strength?<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Don’t desire the night,<br/>when people are cut off in their place.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Take heed, don’t regard iniquity;<br/>for you have chosen this rather than affliction.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Behold, God is exalted in his power.<br/>Who is a teacher like him?<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Who has prescribed his way for him?<br/>Or who can say, ‘You have committed unrighteousness’?<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>“Remember that you magnify his work,<br/>about which men have sung.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>All men have looked on it.<br/>Man sees it afar off.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>Behold, God is great, and we don’t know him.<br/>The number of his years is unsearchable.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>For he draws up the drops of water,<br/>which distill in rain from his vapor,<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>which the skies pour down<br/>and which drop on man abundantly.<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>Indeed, can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds<br/>and the thunderings of his pavilion?<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>Behold, he spreads his light around him.<br/>He covers the bottom of the sea.<br/><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>For by these he judges the people.<br/>He gives food in abundance.<br/><span class="verse" id="V32"></span>He covers his hands with the lightning,<br/>and commands it to strike the mark.<br/><span class="verse" id="V33"></span>Its noise tells about him,<br/>and the livestock also, concerning the storm that comes up.</p></blockquote></section>
