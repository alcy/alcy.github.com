    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Then Job answered,</p><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>“Truly I know that it is so,<br/>but how can man be just with God?<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>If he is pleased to contend with him,<br/>he can’t answer him one time in a thousand.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>God is wise in heart, and mighty in strength.<br/>Who has hardened himself against him and prospered?<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>He removes the mountains, and they don’t know it,<br/>when he overturns them in his anger.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>He shakes the earth out of its place.<br/>Its pillars tremble.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>He commands the sun and it doesn’t rise,<br/>and seals up the stars.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>He alone stretches out the heavens,<br/>and treads on the waves of the sea.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>He makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades,<br/>and the rooms of the south.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>He does great things past finding out;<br/>yes, marvelous things without number.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Behold, he goes by me, and I don’t see him.<br/>He passes on also, but I don’t perceive him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Behold, he snatches away.<br/>Who can hinder him?<br/>Who will ask him, ‘What are you doing?’<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>“God will not withdraw his anger.<br/>The helpers of Rahab stoop under him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>How much less will I answer him,<br/>and choose my words to argue with him?<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Though I were righteous, yet I wouldn’t answer him.<br/>I would make supplication to my judge.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>If I had called, and he had answered me,<br/>yet I wouldn’t believe that he listened to my voice.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>For he breaks me with a storm,<br/>and multiplies my wounds without cause.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>He will not allow me to catch my breath,<br/>but fills me with bitterness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>If it is a matter of strength, behold, he is mighty!<br/>If of justice, ‘Who,’ says he, ‘will summon me?’<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Though I am righteous, my own mouth will condemn me.<br/>Though I am blameless, it will prove me perverse.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>I am blameless.<br/>I don’t respect myself.<br/>I despise my life.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>“It is all the same.<br/>Therefore I say he destroys the blameless and the wicked.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>If the scourge kills suddenly,<br/>he will mock at the trial of the innocent.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>The earth is given into the hand of the wicked.<br/>He covers the faces of its judges.<br/>If not he, then who is it?<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>“Now my days are swifter than a runner.<br/>They flee away. They see no good.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>They have passed away as the swift ships,<br/>as the eagle that swoops on the prey.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint,<br/>I will put off my sad face, and cheer up,’<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>I am afraid of all my sorrows.<br/>I know that you will not hold me innocent.<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>I will be condemned.<br/>Why then do I labor in vain?<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>If I wash myself with snow,<br/>and cleanse my hands with lye,<br/><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>yet you will plunge me in the ditch.<br/>My own clothes will abhor me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V32"></span>For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him,<br/>that we should come together in judgment.<br/><span class="verse" id="V33"></span>There is no umpire between us,<br/>that might lay his hand on us both.<br/><span class="verse" id="V34"></span>Let him take his rod away from me.<br/>Let his terror not make me afraid;<br/><span class="verse" id="V35"></span>then I would speak, and not fear him,<br/>for I am not so in myself. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="job10.htm">→</a></span></p></blockquote></section>
