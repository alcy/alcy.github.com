    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>“Hey! Come, everyone who thirsts, to the waters!<br/>Come, he who has no money, buy, and eat!<br/>Yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Why do you spend money for that which is not bread,<br/>and your labor for that which doesn’t satisfy?<br/>Listen diligently to me, and eat that which is good,<br/>and let your soul delight itself in richness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Turn your ear, and come to me.<br/>Hear, and your soul will live.<br/>I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Behold, I have given him for a witness to the peoples,<br/>a leader and commander to the peoples.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Behold, you shall call a nation that you don’t know;<br/>and a nation that didn’t know you shall run to you,<br/>because of the LORD your God,<br/>and for the Holy One of Israel;<br/>for he has glorified you.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Seek the LORD while he may be found.<br/>Call on him while he is near.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Let the wicked forsake his way,<br/>and the unrighteous man his thoughts.<br/>Let him return to the LORD, and he will have mercy on him,<br/>to our God, for he will freely pardon.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>“For my thoughts are not your thoughts,<br/>and your ways are not my ways,” says the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>“For as the heavens are higher than the earth,<br/>so are my ways higher than your ways,<br/>and my thoughts than your thoughts.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>For as the rain comes down and the snow from the sky,<br/>and doesn’t return there, but waters the earth,<br/>and makes it grow and bud,<br/>and gives seed to the sower and bread to the eater;<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>so is my word that goes out of my mouth:<br/>it will not return to me void,<br/>but it will accomplish that which I please,<br/>and it will prosper in the thing I sent it to do.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>For you shall go out with joy,<br/>and be led out with peace.<br/>The mountains and the hills will break out before you into singing;<br/>and all the trees of the fields will clap their hands.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Instead of the thorn the cypress tree will come up;<br/>and instead of the brier the myrtle tree will come up.<br/>It will make a name for the LORD,<br/>for an everlasting sign that will not be cut off.”</p></blockquote></section>
