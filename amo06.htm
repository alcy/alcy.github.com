Indeed we must not mention the LORD’s name.’</p><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>“For, behold, the LORD commands, and the great house will be smashed to pieces,<br/>and the little house into bits.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Do horses run on the rocky crags?<br/>Does one plow there with oxen?<br/>But you have turned justice into poison,<br/>and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness,<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>you who rejoice in a thing of nothing, who say,<br/>‘Haven’t we taken for ourselves horns by our own strength?’<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>For, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, house of Israel,”<br/>says the LORD, the God of Armies;<br/>“and they will afflict you from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of the Arabah.”</p></blockquote></section>
