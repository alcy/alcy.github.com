    <h1>Psalm 5</h1>

    <p class="psalm-subtitle">For the Chief Musician, with the flutes. A Psalm by David.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Give ear to my words, LORD.<br/>Consider my meditation.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Listen to the voice of my cry, my King and my God,<br/>for I pray to you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>LORD, in the morning you will hear my voice.<br/>In the morning I will lay my requests before you, and will watch expectantly.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>For you are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness.<br/>Evil can’t live with you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>The arrogant will not stand in your sight.<br/>You hate all workers of iniquity.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>You will destroy those who speak lies.<br/>The LORD abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>But as for me, in the abundance of your loving kindness I will come into your house.<br/>I will bow toward your holy temple in reverence of you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Lead me, LORD, in your righteousness because of my enemies.<br/>Make your way straight before my face.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>For there is no faithfulness in their mouth.<br/>Their heart is destruction.<br/>Their throat is an open tomb.<br/>They flatter with their tongue.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Hold them guilty, God.<br/>Let them fall by their own counsels.<br/>Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions,<br/>for they have rebelled against you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>But let all those who take refuge in you rejoice.<br/>Let them always shout for joy, because you defend them.<br/>Let them also who love your name be joyful in you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>For you will bless the righteous.<br/>LORD, you will surround him with favor as with a shield.</p></blockquote></section>
