    <h1>Paul's Letter to the Colossians</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Masters, give to your servants that which is just and equal, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Continue steadfastly in prayer, watching in it with thanksgiving,   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>praying together for us also, that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds,   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>that I may reveal it as I ought to speak.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, redeeming the time.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>All my affairs will be made known to you by Tychicus, the beloved brother, faithful servant, and fellow bondservant in the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that he may know your circumstances and comfort your hearts,   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>together with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will make known to you everything that is going on here.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, greets you, and Mark the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you received instructions, “if he comes to you, receive him”),   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>and Jesus who is called Justus. These are my only fellow workers for God’s Kingdom who are of the circumcision, men who have been a comfort to me.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, salutes you, always striving for you in his prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>For I testify about him that he has great zeal for you, and for those in Laodicea, and for those in Hierapolis.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Luke the beloved physician and Demas greet you.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Greet the brothers who are in Laodicea, with Nymphas and the assembly that is in his house.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>When this letter has been read among you, cause it to be read also in the assembly of the Laodiceans, and that you also read the letter from Laodicea.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Tell Archippus, “Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you. Amen.</p></section>
