    <h1>Psalm 78</h1>

    <p class="psalm-subtitle">A contemplation by Asaph.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Hear my teaching, my people.<br/>Turn your ears to the words of my mouth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>I will open my mouth in a parable.<br/>I will utter dark sayings of old,<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>which we have heard and known,<br/>and our fathers have told us.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>We will not hide them from their children,<br/>telling to the generation to come the praises of the LORD,<br/>his strength, and his wondrous deeds that he has done.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>For he established a covenant in Jacob,<br/>and appointed a teaching in Israel,<br/>which he commanded our fathers,<br/>that they should make them known to their children;<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born;<br/>who should arise and tell their children,<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>that they might set their hope in God,<br/>and not forget God’s deeds,<br/>but keep his commandments,<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>and might not be as their fathers—<br/>a stubborn and rebellious generation,<br/>a generation that didn’t make their hearts loyal,<br/>whose spirit was not steadfast with God.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,<br/>turned back in the day of battle.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>They didn’t keep God’s covenant,<br/>and refused to walk in his law.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>They forgot his doings,<br/>his wondrous deeds that he had shown them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers,<br/>in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>He split the sea, and caused them to pass through.<br/>He made the waters stand as a heap.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>In the daytime he also led them with a cloud,<br/>and all night with a light of fire.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>He split rocks in the wilderness,<br/>and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>He brought streams also out of the rock,<br/>and caused waters to run down like rivers.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Yet they still went on to sin against him,<br/>to rebel against the Most High in the desert.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>They tempted God in their heart<br/>by asking food according to their desire.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Yes, they spoke against God.<br/>They said, “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out,<br/>and streams overflowed.<br/>Can he give bread also?<br/>Will he provide meat for his people?”<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Therefore the LORD heard, and was angry.<br/>A fire was kindled against Jacob,<br/>anger also went up against Israel,<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>because they didn’t believe in God,<br/>and didn’t trust in his salvation.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Yet he commanded the skies above,<br/>and opened the doors of heaven.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>He rained down manna on them to eat,<br/>and gave them food from the sky.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>Man ate the bread of angels.<br/>He sent them food to the full.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>He caused the east wind to blow in the sky.<br/>By his power he guided the south wind.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>He also rained meat on them as the dust,<br/>winged birds as the sand of the seas.<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>He let them fall in the middle of their camp,<br/>around their habitations.<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>So they ate, and were well filled.<br/>He gave them their own desire.<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>They didn’t turn from their cravings.<br/>Their food was yet in their mouths,<br/><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>when the anger of God went up against them,<br/>killed some of their strongest,<br/>and struck down the young men of Israel.<br/><span class="verse" id="V32"></span>For all this they still sinned,<br/>and didn’t believe in his wondrous works.<br/><span class="verse" id="V33"></span>Therefore he consumed their days in vanity,<br/>and their years in terror.<br/><span class="verse" id="V34"></span>When he killed them, then they inquired after him.<br/>They returned and sought God earnestly.<br/><span class="verse" id="V35"></span>They remembered that God was their rock,<br/>the Most High God, their redeemer.<br/><span class="verse" id="V36"></span>But they flattered him with their mouth,<br/>and lied to him with their tongue.<br/><span class="verse" id="V37"></span>For their heart was not right with him,<br/>neither were they faithful in his covenant.<br/><span class="verse" id="V38"></span>But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn’t destroy them.<br/>Yes, many times he turned his anger away,<br/>and didn’t stir up all his wrath.<br/><span class="verse" id="V39"></span>He remembered that they were but flesh,<br/>a wind that passes away, and doesn’t come again.<br/><span class="verse" id="V40"></span>How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,<br/>and grieved him in the desert!<br/><span class="verse" id="V41"></span>They turned again and tempted God,<br/>and provoked the Holy One of Israel.<br/><span class="verse" id="V42"></span>They didn’t remember his hand,<br/>nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;<br/><span class="verse" id="V43"></span>how he set his signs in Egypt,<br/>his wonders in the field of Zoan,<br/><span class="verse" id="V44"></span>he turned their rivers into blood,<br/>and their streams, so that they could not drink.<br/><span class="verse" id="V45"></span>He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;<br/>and frogs, which destroyed them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V46"></span>He also gave their increase to the caterpillar,<br/>and their labor to the locust.<br/><span class="verse" id="V47"></span>He destroyed their vines with hail,<br/>their sycamore fig trees with frost.<br/><span class="verse" id="V48"></span>He also gave over their livestock to the hail,<br/>and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.<br/><span class="verse" id="V49"></span>He threw on them the fierceness of his anger,<br/>wrath, indignation, and trouble,<br/>and a band of angels of evil.<br/><span class="verse" id="V50"></span>He made a path for his anger.<br/>He didn’t spare their soul from death,<br/>but gave their life over to the pestilence,<br/><span class="verse" id="V51"></span>and struck all the firstborn in Egypt,<br/>the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.<br/><span class="verse" id="V52"></span>But he led out his own people like sheep,<br/>and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.<br/><span class="verse" id="V53"></span>He led them safely, so that they weren’t afraid,<br/>but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.<br/><span class="verse" id="V54"></span>He brought them to the border of his sanctuary,<br/>to this mountain, which his right hand had taken.<br/><span class="verse" id="V55"></span>He also drove out the nations before them,<br/>allotted them for an inheritance by line,<br/>and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.<br/><span class="verse" id="V56"></span>Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,<br/>and didn’t keep his testimonies,<br/><span class="verse" id="V57"></span>but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers.<br/>They were twisted like a deceitful bow.<br/><span class="verse" id="V58"></span>For they provoked him to anger with their high places,<br/>and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.<br/><span class="verse" id="V59"></span>When God heard this, he was angry,<br/>and greatly abhorred Israel,<br/><span class="verse" id="V60"></span>so that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh,<br/>the tent which he placed among men,<br/><span class="verse" id="V61"></span>and delivered his strength into captivity,<br/>his glory into the adversary’s hand.<br/><span class="verse" id="V62"></span>He also gave his people over to the sword,<br/>and was angry with his inheritance.<br/><span class="verse" id="V63"></span>Fire devoured their young men.<br/>Their virgins had no wedding song.<br/><span class="verse" id="V64"></span>Their priests fell by the sword,<br/>and their widows couldn’t weep.<br/><span class="verse" id="V65"></span>Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep,<br/>like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.<br/><span class="verse" id="V66"></span>He struck his adversaries backward.<br/>He put them to a perpetual reproach.<br/><span class="verse" id="V67"></span>Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph,<br/>and didn’t choose the tribe of Ephraim,<br/><span class="verse" id="V68"></span>But chose the tribe of Judah,<br/>Mount Zion which he loved.<br/><span class="verse" id="V69"></span>He built his sanctuary like the heights,<br/>like the earth which he has established forever.<br/><span class="verse" id="V70"></span>He also chose David his servant,<br/>and took him from the sheepfolds;<br/><span class="verse" id="V71"></span>from following the ewes that have their young,<br/>he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people,<br/>and Israel, his inheritance.<br/><span class="verse" id="V72"></span>So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart,<br/>and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="psa079.htm">→</a></span></p></blockquote></section>
