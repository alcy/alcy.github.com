    <h1>Psalm 36</h1>

    <p class="psalm-subtitle">For the Chief Musician. By David, the servant of the LORD.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>A revelation is within my heart about the disobedience of the wicked:<br/>There is no fear of God before his eyes.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>For he flatters himself in his own eyes,<br/>too much to detect and hate his sin.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit.<br/>He has ceased to be wise and to do good.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>He plots iniquity on his bed.<br/>He sets himself in a way that is not good.<br/>He doesn’t abhor evil.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Your loving kindness, LORD, is in the heavens.<br/>Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Your righteousness is like the mountains of God.<br/>Your judgments are like a great deep.<br/>LORD, you preserve man and animal.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>How precious is your loving kindness, God!<br/>The children of men take refuge under the shadow of your wings.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>They shall be abundantly satisfied with the abundance of your house.<br/>You will make them drink of the river of your pleasures.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>For with you is the spring of life.<br/>In your light we will see light.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Oh continue your loving kindness to those who know you,<br/>your righteousness to the upright in heart.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Don’t let the foot of pride come against me.<br/>Don’t let the hand of the wicked drive me away.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>There the workers of iniquity are fallen.<br/>They are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise.</p></blockquote></section>
