    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Then I asked, “Where are you going?”</p><p>He said to me, “To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its width and what is its length.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Behold, the angel who talked with me went out, and another angel went out to meet him,   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>and said to him, “Run, speak to this young man, saying, ‘Jerusalem will be inhabited as villages without walls, because of the multitude of men and livestock in it.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>For I,’ says the LORD, ‘will be to her a wall of fire around it, and I will be the glory in the middle of her.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Come! Come! Flee from the land of the north,’ says the LORD; ‘for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the sky,’ says the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>‘Come, Zion! Escape, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.’   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>For the LORD of Armies says: ‘For honor he has sent me to the nations which plundered you; for he who touches you touches the apple of his eye.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they will be a plunder to those who served them; and you will know that the LORD of Armies has sent me.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Sing and rejoice, daughter of Zion! For behold, I come and I will dwell within you,’ says the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Many nations shall join themselves to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people; and I will dwell among you, and you shall know that the LORD of Armies has sent me to you.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>The LORD will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for he has roused himself from his holy habitation!” <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="zec03.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
