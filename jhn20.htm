    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Now on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene went early, while it was still dark, to the tomb, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, “They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we don’t know where they have laid him!”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Therefore Peter and the other disciple went out, and they went toward the tomb.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>They both ran together. The other disciple outran Peter and came to the tomb first.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths lying there; yet he didn’t enter in.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Then Simon Peter came, following him, and entered into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying,   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>and the cloth that had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>So then the other disciple who came first to the tomb also entered in, and he saw and believed.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>For as yet they didn’t know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>So the disciples went away again to their own homes.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>But Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping. So as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb,   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>and she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>They asked her, “Woman, why are you weeping?”</p><p>She said to them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I don’t know where they have laid him.”   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, and didn’t know that it was Jesus.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Jesus said to her, <span class="wj">“Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?”</span></p><p>She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Jesus said to her, <span class="wj">“Mary.”</span></p><p>She turned and said to him, “Rabboni!”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="jhn-20-16-note-1">

The disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Jesus therefore said to them again, <span class="wj">“Peace be to you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you.”</span> <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>When he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, <span class="wj">“Receive the Holy Spirit! </span> <span class="verse" id="V23"></span><span class="wj">If you forgive anyone’s sins, they have been forgiven them. If you retain anyone’s sins, they have been retained.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="jhn-20-24-note-1">
