    <h1>The First Book of Kings</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>When the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the LORD’s name, she came to test him with hard questions.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>She came to Jerusalem with a very great caravan, with camels that bore spices, very much gold, and precious stones; and when she had come to Solomon, she talked with him about all that was in her heart.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Solomon answered all her questions. There wasn’t anything hidden from the king which he didn’t tell her.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>When the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built,   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>the food of his table, the sitting of his servants, the attendance of his officials, their clothing, his cup bearers, and his ascent by which he went up to the LORD’s house, there was no more spirit in her.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>She said to the king, “It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts and of your wisdom.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>However, I didn’t believe the words until I came and my eyes had seen it. Behold, not even half was told me! Your wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Happy are your men, happy are these your servants who stand continually before you, who hear your wisdom.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Blessed is the LORD your God, who delighted in you, to set you on the throne of Israel. Because the LORD loved Israel forever, therefore he made you king, to do justice and righteousness.”   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>She gave the king one hundred twenty talents of gold, and a very great quantity of spices, and precious stones. Never again was there such an abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>The fleet of Hiram that brought gold from Ophir also brought in from Ophir great quantities of almug trees<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="1ki-10-11-note-1">

        possibly an Indian sandalwood, with nice grain and a pleasant scent, and good for woodworking
        </span> and precious stones.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>The king made of the almug trees pillars for the LORD’s house and for the king’s house, harps also and stringed instruments for the singers; no such almug trees came or were seen to this day.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, in addition to that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own land, she and her servants.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred sixty-six talents<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="1ki-10-14-note-1">

        A talent is about 30 kilograms or 66 pounds or 965 Troy ounces, so 666 talents is about 20 metric tons

Nothing like it was made in any kingdom.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>All King Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. None were of silver, because it was considered of little value in the days of Solomon.   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>For the king had a fleet of ships of Tarshish at sea with Hiram’s fleet. Once every three years the fleet of Tarshish came bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>So King Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>All the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom which God had put in his heart.   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>Year after year, every man brought his tribute, vessels of silver, vessels of gold, clothing, armor, spices, horses, and mules.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen. He had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen. He kept them in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V27"></span>The king made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem, and cedars as common as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland.   <span class="verse" id="V28"></span>The horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt. The king’s merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price.   <span class="verse" id="V29"></span>A chariot was imported from Egypt for six hundred shekels<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="1ki-10-29-note-1">
