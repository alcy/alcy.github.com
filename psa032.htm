    <h1>Psalm 32</h1>

    <p class="psalm-subtitle">By David. A contemplative psalm.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Blessed is he whose disobedience is forgiven,<br/>whose sin is covered.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Blessed is the man to whom the LORD doesn’t impute iniquity,<br/>in whose spirit there is no deceit.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>When I kept silence, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>For day and night your hand was heavy on me.<br/>My strength was sapped in the heat of summer.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>I acknowledged my sin to you.<br/>I didn’t hide my iniquity.<br/>I said, I will confess my transgressions to the LORD,<br/>and you forgave the iniquity of my sin.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>For this, let everyone who is godly pray to you in a time when you may be found.<br/>Surely when the great waters overflow, they shall not reach to him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>You are my hiding place.<br/>You will preserve me from trouble.<br/>You will surround me with songs of deliverance.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go.<br/>I will counsel you with my eye on you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Don’t be like the horse, or like the mule, which have no understanding,<br/>who are controlled by bit and bridle, or else they will not come near to you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Many sorrows come to the wicked,<br/>but loving kindness shall surround him who trusts in the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, you righteous!<br/>Shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart!</p></blockquote></section>
