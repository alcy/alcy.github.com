        </span> that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish others.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>But I write the more boldly to you in part as reminding you, because of the grace that was given to me by God,   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>that I should be a servant of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, serving as a priest of the Good News of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>I have therefore my boasting in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>For I will not dare to speak of any things except those which Christ worked through me for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of God’s Spirit; so that from Jerusalem and around as far as to Illyricum, I have fully preached the Good News of Christ;   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>yes, making it my aim to preach the Good News, not where Christ was already named, that I might not build on another’s foundation.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>But, as it is written,</p><blockquote><p>“They will see, to whom no news of him came.<br/>They who haven’t heard will understand.”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="rom-15-21-note-1">

For I hope to see you on my journey, and to be helped on my way there by you, if first I may enjoy your company for a while.   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>But now, I say, I am going to Jerusalem, serving the saints.   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>For it has been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints who are at Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V27"></span>Yes, it has been their good pleasure, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it to them also to serve them in material things.   <span class="verse" id="V28"></span>When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by way of you to Spain.   <span class="verse" id="V29"></span>I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of the Good News of Christ.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>Now I beg you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,   <span class="verse" id="V31"></span>that I may be delivered from those who are disobedient in Judea, and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,   <span class="verse" id="V32"></span>that I may come to you in joy through the will of God, and together with you, find rest.   <span class="verse" id="V33"></span>Now the God of peace be with you all.
