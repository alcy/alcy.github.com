    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>The king rejoices in your strength, LORD!<br/>How greatly he rejoices in your salvation!<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>You have given him his heart’s desire,<br/>and have not withheld the request of his lips.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For you meet him with the blessings of goodness.<br/>You set a crown of fine gold on his head.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>He asked life of you and you gave it to him,<br/>even length of days forever and ever.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>His glory is great in your salvation.<br/>You lay honor and majesty on him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>For you make him most blessed forever.<br/>You make him glad with joy in your presence.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>For the king trusts in the LORD.<br/>Through the loving kindness of the Most High, he shall not be moved.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Your hand will find out all of your enemies.<br/>Your right hand will find out those who hate you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>You will make them as a fiery furnace in the time of your anger.<br/>The LORD will swallow them up in his wrath.<br/>The fire shall devour them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>You will destroy their descendants from the earth,<br/>their posterity from among the children of men.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>For they intended evil against you.<br/>They plotted evil against you which cannot succeed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>For you will make them turn their back,<br/>when you aim drawn bows at their face.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Be exalted, LORD, in your strength,<br/>so we will sing and praise your power.</p></blockquote></section>
