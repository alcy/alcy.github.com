You shall surely bring them again to your brother.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>If your brother isn’t near to you, or if you don’t know him, then you shall bring it home to your house, and it shall be with you until your brother comes looking for it, and you shall restore it to him.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>So you shall do with his donkey. So you shall do with his garment. So you shall do with every lost thing of your brother’s, which he has lost and you have found. You may not hide yourself.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>You shall not see your brother’s donkey or his ox fallen down by the way, and hide yourself from them. You shall surely help him to lift them up again.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>A woman shall not wear men’s clothing, neither shall a man put on women’s clothing; for whoever does these things is an abomination to the LORD your God.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>If you come across a bird’s nest on the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the hen sitting on the young, or on the eggs, you shall not take the hen with the young.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>You shall surely let the hen go, but the young you may take for yourself, that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>When you build a new house, then you shall make a railing around your roof, so that you don’t bring blood on your house if anyone falls from there.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed, lest all the fruit be defiled, the seed which you have sown, and the increase of the vineyard.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>You shall not wear clothes of wool and linen woven together.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>You shall make yourselves fringes<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="deu-22-12-note-1">

So you shall remove the evil from among you.   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>But if the man finds the lady who is pledged to be married in the field, and the man forces her and lies with her, then only the man who lay with her shall die;   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>but to the lady you shall do nothing.
