The LORD heard our voice, and saw our affliction, our toil, and our oppression.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>The LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, with great terror, with signs, and with wonders;   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>and he has brought us into this place, and has given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruit of the ground, which you, the LORD, have given me.” You shall set it down before the LORD your God, and worship before the LORD your God.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>You shall rejoice in all the good which the LORD your God has given to you, and to your house, you, and the Levite, and the foreigner who is among you.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>When you have finished tithing all the tithe of your increase in the third year, which is the year of tithing, then you shall give it to the Levite, to the foreigner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, that they may eat within your gates and be filled.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>You shall say before the LORD your God, “I have put away the holy things out of my house, and also have given them to the Levite, to the foreigner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all your commandment which you have commanded me.
