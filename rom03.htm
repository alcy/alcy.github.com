    <h1>Paul's Letter to the Romans</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Then what advantage does the Jew have? Or what is the profit of circumcision?   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Much in every way! Because first of all, they were entrusted with the revelations of God.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For what if some were without faith? Will their lack of faith nullify the faithfulness of God?   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>May it never be! Yes, let God be found true, but every man a liar. As it is written,</p><blockquote><p>“that you might be justified in your words,<br/>and might prevail when you come into judgment.”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="rom-3-4-note-1">

</span></p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what will we say? Is God unrighteous who inflicts wrath? I speak like men do.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>May it never be! For then how will God judge the world?   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>For if the truth of God through my lie abounded to his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), “Let’s do evil, that good may come?” Those who say so are justly condemned.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>What then? Are we better than they? No, in no way. For we previously warned both Jews and Greeks that they are all under sin.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>As it is written,</p><blockquote><p>“There is no one righteous;<br/>no, not one.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>There is no one who understands.<br/>There is no one who seeks after God.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>They have all turned away.<br/>They have together become unprofitable.<br/>There is no one who does good,<br/>no, not so much as one.”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="rom-3-12-note-1">

For there is no distinction,   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God;   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>whom God sent to be an atoning sacrifice<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="rom-3-25-note-1">

        or, a propitiation
        </span> through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness through the passing over of prior sins, in God’s forbearance;   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>to demonstrate his righteousness at this present time, that he might himself be just and the justifier of him who has faith in Jesus.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>Where then is the boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? Of works? No, but by a law of faith.   <span class="verse" id="V28"></span>We maintain therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.   <span class="verse" id="V29"></span>Or is God the God of Jews only? Isn’t he the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,   <span class="verse" id="V30"></span>since indeed there is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>Do we then nullify the law through faith? May it never be! No, we establish the law. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="rom04.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
