    <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
    
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Whoever loves correction loves knowledge,<br/>but he who hates reproof is stupid.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>A good man shall obtain favor from the LORD,<br/>but he will condemn a man of wicked plans.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>A man shall not be established by wickedness,<br/>but the root of the righteous shall not be moved.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>A worthy woman is the crown of her husband,<br/>but a disgraceful wife is as rottenness in his bones.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>The thoughts of the righteous are just,<br/>but the advice of the wicked is deceitful.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>The words of the wicked are about lying in wait for blood,<br/>but the speech of the upright rescues them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>The wicked are overthrown, and are no more,<br/>but the house of the righteous shall stand.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>A man shall be commended according to his wisdom,<br/>but he who has a warped mind shall be despised.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Better is he who is little known, and has a servant,<br/>than he who honors himself and lacks bread.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>A righteous man respects the life of his animal,<br/>but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>He who tills his land shall have plenty of bread,<br/>but he who chases fantasies is void of understanding.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>The wicked desires the plunder of evil men,<br/>but the root of the righteous flourishes.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>An evil man is trapped by sinfulness of lips,<br/>but the righteous shall come out of trouble.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth.<br/>The work of a man’s hands shall be rewarded to him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>The way of a fool is right in his own eyes,<br/>but he who is wise listens to counsel.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>A fool shows his annoyance the same day,<br/>but one who overlooks an insult is prudent.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>He who is truthful testifies honestly,<br/>but a false witness lies.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>There is one who speaks rashly like the piercing of a sword,<br/>but the tongue of the wise heals.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Truth’s lips will be established forever,<br/>but a lying tongue is only momentary.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Deceit is in the heart of those who plot evil,<br/>but joy comes to the promoters of peace.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>No mischief shall happen to the righteous,<br/>but the wicked shall be filled with evil.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Lying lips are an abomination to the LORD,<br/>but those who do the truth are his delight.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>A prudent man keeps his knowledge,<br/>but the hearts of fools proclaim foolishness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>The hands of the diligent ones shall rule,<br/>but laziness ends in slave labor.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>Anxiety in a man’s heart weighs it down,<br/>but a kind word makes it glad.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>A righteous person is cautious in friendship,<br/>but the way of the wicked leads them astray.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>The slothful man doesn’t roast his game,<br/>but the possessions of diligent men are prized.<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>In the way of righteousness is life;<br/>in its path there is no death. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="pro13.htm">→</a></span></p></blockquote></section>
