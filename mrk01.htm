He was with the wild animals; and the angels were serving him.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Now after John was taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Good News of God’s Kingdom,   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>and saying, <span class="wj">“The time is fulfilled, and God’s Kingdom is at hand! Repent, and believe in the Good News.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for men.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Immediately they left their nets, and followed him.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Going on a little further from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets.   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Immediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>saying, “Ha! What do we have to do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are: the Holy One of God!”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>Jesus rebuked him, saying, <span class="wj">“Be quiet, and come out of him!” </span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>The unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.   <span class="verse" id="V27"></span>They were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, “What is this?

People came to him from everywhere.</p></section>
