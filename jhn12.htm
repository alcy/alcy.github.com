Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Therefore Mary took a pound<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="jhn-12-3-note-1">

</span> <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>His disciples didn’t understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about him, and that they had done these things to him.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead was testifying about it.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>For this cause also the multitude went and met him, because they heard that he had done this sign.   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, “See how you accomplish nothing. Behold, the world has gone after him.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Now there were certain Greeks among those who went up to worship at the feast.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Therefore, these came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, “Sir, we want to see Jesus.”   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Philip came and told Andrew, and in turn, Andrew came with Philip, and they told Jesus.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Jesus answered them, <span class="wj">“The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. </span> <span class="verse" id="V24"></span><span class="wj">Most certainly I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone.
