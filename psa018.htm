    <h1>Psalm 18</h1>

    <p class="psalm-subtitle">For the Chief Musician. By David the servant of the LORD, who spoke to the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul. He said,</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>I love you, LORD, my strength.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer;<br/>my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge;<br/>my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>I call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised;<br/>and I am saved from my enemies.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>The cords of death surrounded me.<br/>The floods of ungodliness made me afraid.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>The cords of Sheol<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="psa-18-5-note-1">

            Sheol is the place of the dead.
            </span> were around me.<br/>The snares of death came on me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>In my distress I called on the LORD,<br/>and cried to my God.<br/>He heard my voice out of his temple.<br/>My cry before him came into his ears.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Then the earth shook and trembled.<br/>The foundations also of the mountains quaked and were shaken,<br/>because he was angry.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Smoke went out of his nostrils.<br/>Consuming fire came out of his mouth.<br/>Coals were kindled by it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>He bowed the heavens also, and came down.<br/>Thick darkness was under his feet.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>He rode on a cherub, and flew.<br/>Yes, he soared on the wings of the wind.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>He made darkness his hiding place, his pavilion around him,<br/>darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed,<br/>hailstones and coals of fire.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>The LORD also thundered in the sky.<br/>The Most High uttered his voice:<br/>hailstones and coals of fire.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>He sent out his arrows, and scattered them.<br/>He routed them with great lightning bolts.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Then the channels of waters appeared.<br/>The foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke, LORD,<br/>at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>He sent from on high.<br/>He took me.<br/>He drew me out of many waters.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>He delivered me from my strong enemy,<br/>from those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>They came on me in the day of my calamity,<br/>but the LORD was my support.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>He brought me out also into a large place.<br/>He delivered me, because he delighted in me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness.<br/>According to the cleanness of my hands, he has recompensed me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>For I have kept the ways of the LORD,<br/>and have not wickedly departed from my God.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>For all his ordinances were before me.<br/>I didn’t put away his statutes from me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>I was also blameless with him.<br/>I kept myself from my iniquity.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Therefore the LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness,<br/>according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>With the merciful you will show yourself merciful.<br/>With the perfect man, you will show yourself perfect.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>With the pure, you will show yourself pure.<br/>With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>For you will save the afflicted people,<br/>but the arrogant eyes you will bring down.<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>For you will light my lamp, LORD.<br/>My God will light up my darkness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>For by you, I advance through a troop.<br/>By my God, I leap over a wall.<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>As for God, his way is perfect.<br/>The LORD’s word is tried.<br/>He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>For who is God, except the LORD?<br/>Who is a rock, besides our God,<br/><span class="verse" id="V32"></span>the God who arms me with strength, and makes my way perfect?<br/><span class="verse" id="V33"></span>He makes my feet like deer’s feet,<br/>and sets me on my high places.<br/><span class="verse" id="V34"></span>He teaches my hands to war,<br/>so that my arms bend a bow of bronze.<br/><span class="verse" id="V35"></span>You have also given me the shield of your salvation.<br/>Your right hand sustains me.<br/>Your gentleness has made me great.<br/><span class="verse" id="V36"></span>You have enlarged my steps under me,<br/>My feet have not slipped.<br/><span class="verse" id="V37"></span>I will pursue my enemies, and overtake them.<br/>I won’t turn away until they are consumed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V38"></span>I will strike them through, so that they will not be able to rise.<br/>They shall fall under my feet.<br/><span class="verse" id="V39"></span>For you have armed me with strength to the battle.<br/>You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V40"></span>You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me,<br/>that I might cut off those who hate me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V41"></span>They cried, but there was no one to save;<br/>even to the LORD, but he didn’t answer them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V42"></span>Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind.<br/>I cast them out as the mire of the streets.<br/><span class="verse" id="V43"></span>You have delivered me from the strivings of the people.<br/>You have made me the head of the nations.<br/>A people whom I have not known shall serve me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V44"></span>As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me.<br/>The foreigners shall submit themselves to me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V45"></span>The foreigners shall fade away,<br/>and shall come trembling out of their strongholds.<br/><span class="verse" id="V46"></span>The LORD lives!
