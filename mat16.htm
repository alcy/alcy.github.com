    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>The Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing him, asked him to show them a sign from heaven.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>But he answered them, <span class="wj">“When it is evening, you say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.’ </span> <span class="verse" id="V3"></span><span class="wj">In the morning, ‘It will be foul weather today, for the sky is red and threatening.’ Hypocrites! You know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but you can’t discern the signs of the times! </span> <span class="verse" id="V4"></span><span class="wj">An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there will be no sign given to it, except the sign of the prophet Jonah.”</span></p><p>He left them and departed.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>The disciples came to the other side and had forgotten to take bread.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>They reasoned among themselves, saying, “We brought no bread.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Jesus, perceiving it, said, <span class="wj">“Why do you reason among yourselves, you of little faith, because you have brought no bread? </span> <span class="verse" id="V9"></span><span class="wj">Don’t you yet perceive or remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up, </span> <span class="verse" id="V10"></span><span class="wj">or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up? </span> <span class="verse" id="V11"></span><span class="wj">How is it that you don’t perceive that I didn’t speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” </span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Then they understood that he didn’t tell them to beware of the yeast of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, <span class="wj">“Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>They said, “Some say John the Baptizer, some, Elijah, and others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“But who do you say that I am?”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Jesus answered him, <span class="wj">“Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. </span> <span class="verse" id="V18"></span><span class="wj">I also tell you that you are Peter,</span><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="mat-16-18-note-1">
