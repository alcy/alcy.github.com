You know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but you can’t discern the signs of the times! </span> <span class="verse" id="V4"></span><span class="wj">An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there will be no sign given to it, except the sign of the prophet Jonah.”</span></p><p>He left them and departed.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>The disciples came to the other side and had forgotten to take bread.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>They reasoned among themselves, saying, “We brought no bread.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Jesus, perceiving it, said, <span class="wj">“Why do you reason among yourselves, you of little faith, because you have brought no bread? </span> <span class="verse" id="V9"></span><span class="wj">Don’t you yet perceive or remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up, </span> <span class="verse" id="V10"></span><span class="wj">or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up? </span> <span class="verse" id="V11"></span><span class="wj">How is it that you don’t perceive that I didn’t speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” </span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Then they understood that he didn’t tell them to beware of the yeast of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, <span class="wj">“Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>They said, “Some say John the Baptizer, some, Elijah, and others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“But who do you say that I am?”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Jesus answered him, <span class="wj">“Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. </span> <span class="verse" id="V18"></span><span class="wj">I also tell you that you are Peter,</span><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="mat-16-18-note-1">
