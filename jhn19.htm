Pilate said to them, “Behold, the man!”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify!”</p><p>Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no basis for a charge against him.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>The Jews answered him, “We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>When therefore Pilate heard this saying, he was more afraid.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>He entered into the Praetorium again, and said to Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave him no answer.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Pilate therefore said to him, “Aren’t you speaking to me? Don’t you know that I have power to release you and have power to crucify you?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Jesus answered, <span class="wj">“You would have no power at all against me, unless it were given to you from above. Therefore he who delivered me to you has greater sin.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>At this, Pilate was seeking to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, “If you release this man, you aren’t Caesar’s friend! Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar!”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called “The Pavement”, but in Hebrew, “Gabbatha.”   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Now it was the Preparation Day of the Passover, at about the sixth hour.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="jhn-19-14-note-1">

        “the sixth hour” would have been 6:00 a.m. according to the Roman timekeeping system, or noon for the Jewish timekeeping system in use, then.
        </span> He said to the Jews, “Behold, your King!”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>They cried out, “Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!”</p><p>Pilate said to them, “Shall I crucify your King?”</p><p>The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar!”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>So then he delivered him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led him away.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>He went out, bearing his cross, to the place called “The Place of a Skull”, which is called in Hebrew, “Golgotha”,   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the middle.   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. There was written, “JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.”   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Therefore many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, “Don’t write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but, ‘he said, “I am King of the Jews.” ’ ”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the tunic. Now the tunic was without seam, woven from the top throughout.   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Then they said to one another, “Let’s not tear it, but cast lots for it to decide whose it will be,” that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says,</p><blockquote><p>“They parted my garments among them.<br/>They cast lots for my clothing.”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="jhn-19-24-note-1">

Pilate gave him permission. He came therefore and took away his body.   <span class="verse" id="V39"></span>Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred Roman pounds.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="jhn-19-39-note-1">

In the garden was a new tomb in which no man had ever yet been laid.   <span class="verse" id="V42"></span>Then, because of the Jews’ Preparation Day (for the tomb was near at hand), they laid Jesus there.</p></section>
