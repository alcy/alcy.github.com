    <h1>Exodus</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 31</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>“Behold, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all kinds of workmanship,   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>to devise skillful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze,   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all kinds of workmanship.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Behold, I myself have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of all who are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded you:   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the covenant, the mercy seat that is on it, all the furniture of the Tent,   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>the table and its vessels, the pure lamp stand with all its vessels, the altar of incense,   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>the altar of burnt offering with all its vessels, the basin and its base,   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>the finely worked garments—the holy garments for Aaron the priest, the garments of his sons to minister in the priest’s office—   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded you they shall do.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>The LORD spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>“Speak also to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Most certainly you shall keep my Sabbaths; for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I am the LORD who sanctifies you.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>You shall keep the Sabbath therefore, for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the LORD. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day shall surely be put to death.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>It is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever; for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.’ ”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>When he finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, he gave Moses the two tablets of the covenant, stone tablets, written with God’s finger.</p></section>
