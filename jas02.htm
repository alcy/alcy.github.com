    <h1>The Letter from James</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>My brothers, don’t hold the faith of our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with partiality.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>For if a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, comes into your synagogue,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="jas-2-2-note-1">

<input class="margin-toggle" id="jas-2-2-note-1" type="checkbox"/>

        or, meeting
        </span> and a poor man in filthy clothing also comes in,   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>and you pay special attention to him who wears the fine clothing and say, “Sit here in a good place;” and you tell the poor man, “Stand there,” or “Sit by my footstool”   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>haven’t you shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Listen, my beloved brothers. Didn’t God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him?   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>But you have dishonored the poor man. Don’t the rich oppress you and personally drag you before the courts?   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Don’t they blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called?</p><p><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>However, if you fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="jas-2-8-note-1">

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="lev19.htm#v18">Leviticus 19:18</a>
</span> you do well.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>But if you show partiality, you commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>For whoever keeps the whole law, and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>For he who said, “Do not commit adultery,”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="jas-2-11-note-1">

<input class="margin-toggle" id="jas-2-11-note-1" type="checkbox"/>

<a href="exo20.htm#v14">Exodus 20:14</a>; <a href="deu05.htm#v18">Deuteronomy 5:18</a>
</span> also said, “Do not commit murder.”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="jas-2-11-note-2">

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="exo20.htm#v13">Exodus 20:13</a>; <a href="deu05.htm#v17">Deuteronomy 5:17</a>
</span> Now if you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>So speak and so do as men who are to be judged by the law of freedom.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>For judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>What good is it, my brothers, if a man says he has faith, but has no works? Can faith save him?   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>And if a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food,   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>and one of you tells them, “Go in peace. Be warmed and filled;” yet you didn’t give them the things the body needs, what good is it?   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead in itself.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Yes, a man will say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without works, and I will show you my faith by my works.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>You believe that God is one. You do well. The demons also believe—and shudder.   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>But do you want to know, vain man, that faith apart from works is dead?   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Wasn’t Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>You see that faith worked with his works, and by works faith was perfected.   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>So the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness,”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="jas-2-23-note-1">

<a href="gen15.htm#v6">Genesis 15:6</a>
</span> and he was called the friend of God.   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>You see then that by works a man is justified, and not only by faith.   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>In the same way, wasn’t Rahab the prostitute also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out another way?   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.</p></section>
