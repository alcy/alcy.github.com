    <h1>The Proverbs</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
    
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>My son, if you have become collateral for your neighbor,<br/>if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger,<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>you are trapped by the words of your mouth;<br/>you are ensnared with the words of your mouth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself,<br/>since you have come into the hand of your neighbor.<br/>Go, humble yourself.<br/>Press your plea with your neighbor.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Give no sleep to your eyes,<br/>nor slumber to your eyelids.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,<br/>like a bird from the snare of the fowler.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Go to the ant, you sluggard.<br/>Consider her ways, and be wise;<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>which having no chief, overseer, or ruler,<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>provides her bread in the summer,<br/>and gathers her food in the harvest.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>How long will you sleep, sluggard?<br/>When will you arise out of your sleep?<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>A little sleep, a little slumber,<br/>a little folding of the hands to sleep—<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>so your poverty will come as a robber,<br/>and your scarcity as an armed man.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>A worthless person, a man of iniquity,<br/>is he who walks with a perverse mouth,<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet,<br/>who motions with his fingers,<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>in whose heart is perverseness,<br/>who devises evil continually,<br/>who always sows discord.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Therefore his calamity will come suddenly.<br/>He will be broken suddenly, and that without remedy.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>There are six things which the LORD hates;<br/>yes, seven which are an abomination to him:<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>arrogant eyes, a lying tongue,<br/>hands that shed innocent blood,<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>a heart that devises wicked schemes,<br/>feet that are swift in running to mischief,<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>a false witness who utters lies,<br/>and he who sows discord among brothers.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>My son, keep your father’s commandment,<br/>and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Bind them continually on your heart.<br/>Tie them around your neck.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>When you walk, it will lead you.<br/>When you sleep, it will watch over you.<br/>When you awake, it will talk with you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>For the commandment is a lamp,<br/>and the law is light.<br/>Reproofs of instruction are the way of life,<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>to keep you from the immoral woman,<br/>from the flattery of the wayward wife’s tongue.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>Don’t lust after her beauty in your heart,<br/>neither let her captivate you with her eyelids.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread.<br/>The adulteress hunts for your precious life.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>Can a man scoop fire into his lap,<br/>and his clothes not be burned?<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>Or can one walk on hot coals,<br/>and his feet not be scorched?<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>So is he who goes in to his neighbor’s wife.<br/>Whoever touches her will not be unpunished.<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>Men don’t despise a thief<br/>if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry,<br/><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>but if he is found, he shall restore seven times.<br/>He shall give all the wealth of his house.<br/><span class="verse" id="V32"></span>He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding.<br/>He who does it destroys his own soul.<br/><span class="verse" id="V33"></span>He will get wounds and dishonor.<br/>His reproach will not be wiped away.<br/><span class="verse" id="V34"></span>For jealousy arouses the fury of the husband.<br/>He won’t spare in the day of vengeance.<br/><span class="verse" id="V35"></span>He won’t regard any ransom,<br/>neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts.</p></blockquote></section>
