When he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Therefore I didn’t even think myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be healed.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>For I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude who followed him, <span class="wj">“I tell you, I have not found such great faith, no, not in Israel.”</span> <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Those who were sent, returning to the house, found that the servant who had been sick was well.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Soon afterwards, he went to a city called Nain. Many of his disciples, along with a great multitude, went with him.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Now when he came near to the gate of the city, behold, one who was dead was carried out, the only born<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="luk-7-12-note-1">
