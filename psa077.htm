    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>My cry goes to God!<br/>Indeed, I cry to God for help,<br/>and for him to listen to me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord.<br/>My hand was stretched out in the night, and didn’t get tired.<br/>My soul refused to be comforted.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>I remember God, and I groan.<br/>I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>You hold my eyelids open.<br/>I am so troubled that I can’t speak.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>I have considered the days of old,<br/>the years of ancient times.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>I remember my song in the night.<br/>I consider in my own heart;<br/>my spirit diligently inquires:<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>“Will the Lord reject us forever?<br/>Will he be favorable no more?<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Has his loving kindness vanished forever?<br/>Does his promise fail for generations?<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Has God forgotten to be gracious?<br/>Has he, in anger, withheld his compassion?”<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Then I thought, “I will appeal to this:<br/>the years of the right hand of the Most High.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>I will remember the LORD’s deeds;<br/>for I will remember your wonders of old.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>I will also meditate on all your work,<br/>and consider your doings.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Your way, God, is in the sanctuary.<br/>What god is great like God?<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>You are the God who does wonders.<br/>You have made your strength known among the peoples.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>You have redeemed your people with your arm,<br/>the sons of Jacob and Joseph.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>The waters saw you, God.<br/>The waters saw you, and they writhed.<br/>The depths also convulsed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>The clouds poured out water.<br/>The skies resounded with thunder.<br/>Your arrows also flashed around.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind.<br/>The lightnings lit up the world.<br/>The earth trembled and shook.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Your way was through the sea,<br/>your paths through the great waters.<br/>Your footsteps were not known.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>You led your people like a flock,<br/>by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</p></blockquote></section>
