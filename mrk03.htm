    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>He entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there whose hand was withered.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>They watched him, whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>He said to the man whose hand was withered, <span class="wj">“Stand up.”</span> <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good or to do harm? To save a life or to kill?”</span> But they were silent.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>When he had looked around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their hearts, he said to the man, <span class="wj">“Stretch out your hand.” </span> He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>The Pharisees went out, and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples; and a great multitude followed him from Galilee, from Judea,   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>from Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from around Tyre and Sidon. A great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>He spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they wouldn’t press on him.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>For he had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>The unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him and cried, “You are the Son of God!”   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>He sternly warned them that they should not make him known.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>He went up into the mountain and called to himself those whom he wanted, and they went to him.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>He appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons:   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter);   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>James the son of Zebedee; and John, the brother of James, (whom he called Boanerges, which means, Sons of Thunder);   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot;   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</p><p>Then he came into a house.   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>The multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>When his friends heard it, they went out to seize him; for they said, “He is insane.”   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, “He has Beelzebul,” and, “By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>He summoned them and said to them in parables, <span class="wj">“How can Satan cast out Satan? </span> <span class="verse" id="V24"></span><span class="wj">If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. </span> <span class="verse" id="V25"></span><span class="wj">If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand. </span> <span class="verse" id="V26"></span><span class="wj">If Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he can’t stand, but has an end. </span> <span class="verse" id="V27"></span><span class="wj">But no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder unless he first binds the strong man; then he will plunder his house. </span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V28"></span><span class="wj">“Most certainly I tell you, all sins of the descendants of man will be forgiven, including their blasphemies with which they may blaspheme; </span> <span class="verse" id="V29"></span><span class="wj">but whoever may blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is subject to eternal condemnation.”</span><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="mrk-3-29-note-1">
