    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>My son, keep my words.<br/>Lay up my commandments within you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Keep my commandments and live!<br/>Guard my teaching as the apple of your eye.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Bind them on your fingers.<br/>Write them on the tablet of your heart.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Tell wisdom, “You are my sister.”<br/>Call understanding your relative,<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>that they may keep you from the strange woman,<br/>from the foreigner who flatters with her words.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>For at the window of my house,<br/>I looked out through my lattice.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>I saw among the simple ones.<br/>I discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding,<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>passing through the street near her corner,<br/>he went the way to her house,<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>in the twilight, in the evening of the day,<br/>in the middle of the night and in the darkness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Behold, there a woman met him with the attire of a prostitute,<br/>and with crafty intent.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>She is loud and defiant.<br/>Her feet don’t stay in her house.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Now she is in the streets, now in the squares,<br/>and lurking at every corner.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>So she caught him, and kissed him.<br/>With an impudent face she said to him:<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>“Sacrifices of peace offerings are with me.<br/>Today I have paid my vows.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Therefore I came out to meet you,<br/>to diligently seek your face,<br/>and I have found you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry,<br/>with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Come, let’s take our fill of loving until the morning.<br/>Let’s solace ourselves with loving.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>For my husband isn’t at home.<br/>He has gone on a long journey.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>He has taken a bag of money with him.<br/>He will come home at the full moon.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>With persuasive words, she led him astray.<br/>With the flattering of her lips, she seduced him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>He followed her immediately,<br/>as an ox goes to the slaughter,<br/>as a fool stepping into a noose.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Until an arrow strikes through his liver,<br/>as a bird hurries to the snare,<br/>and doesn’t know that it will cost his life.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Now therefore, sons, listen to me.<br/>Pay attention to the words of my mouth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>Don’t let your heart turn to her ways.<br/>Don’t go astray in her paths,<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>for she has thrown down many wounded.<br/>Yes, all her slain are a mighty army.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>Her house is the way to Sheol,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="pro-7-27-note-1">
