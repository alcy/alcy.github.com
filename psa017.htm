    <p class="psalm-subtitle">A Prayer by David.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Hear, LORD, my righteous plea.<br/>Give ear to my prayer that doesn’t go out of deceitful lips.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Let my sentence come out of your presence.<br/>Let your eyes look on equity.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>You have proved my heart.<br/>You have visited me in the night.<br/>You have tried me, and found nothing.<br/>I have resolved that my mouth shall not disobey.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>As for the deeds of men, by the word of your lips,<br/>I have kept myself from the ways of the violent.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>My steps have held fast to your paths.<br/>My feet have not slipped.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>I have called on you, for you will answer me, God.<br/>Turn your ear to me.<br/>Hear my speech.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Show your marvelous loving kindness,<br/>you who save those who take refuge by your right hand from their enemies.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Keep me as the apple of your eye.<br/>Hide me under the shadow of your wings,<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>from the wicked who oppress me,<br/>my deadly enemies, who surround me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>They close up their callous hearts.<br/>With their mouth they speak proudly.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>They have now surrounded us in our steps.<br/>They set their eyes to cast us down to the earth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey,<br/>as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Arise, LORD, confront him.<br/>Cast him down.<br/>Deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword,<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>from men by your hand, LORD,<br/>from men of the world, whose portion is in this life.<br/>You fill the belly of your cherished ones.<br/>Your sons have plenty,<br/>and they store up wealth for their children.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>As for me, I shall see your face in righteousness.<br/>I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with seeing your form.</p></blockquote></section>
