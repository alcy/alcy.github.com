    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>How beautiful are your feet in sandals, prince’s daughter!</p><blockquote><p>Your rounded thighs are like jewels,<br/>the work of the hands of a skillful workman.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Your body is like a round goblet,<br/>no mixed wine is wanting.<br/>Your waist is like a heap of wheat,<br/>set about with lilies.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Your two breasts are like two fawns,<br/>that are twins of a roe.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Your neck is like an ivory tower.<br/>Your eyes are like the pools in Heshbon by the gate of Bathrabbim.<br/>Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Your head on you is like Carmel.<br/>The hair of your head like purple.<br/>The king is held captive in its tresses.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>How beautiful and how pleasant you are,<br/>love, for delights!<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>This, your stature, is like a palm tree,<br/>your breasts like its fruit.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>I said, “I will climb up into the palm tree.<br/>I will take hold of its fruit.”<br/>Let your breasts be like clusters of the vine,<br/>the smell of your breath like apples.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Your mouth is like the best wine,<br/>that goes down smoothly for my beloved,<br/>gliding through the lips of those who are asleep.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>I am my beloved’s.<br/>His desire is toward me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Come, my beloved! Let’s go out into the field.<br/>Let’s lodge in the villages.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Let’s go early up to the vineyards.<br/>Let’s see whether the vine has budded,<br/>its blossom is open,<br/>and the pomegranates are in flower.<br/>There I will give you my love.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>The mandrakes produce fragrance.<br/>At our doors are all kinds of precious fruits, new and old,<br/>which I have stored up for you, my beloved.</p></blockquote></section>
