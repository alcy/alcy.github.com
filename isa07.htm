    <h1>Isaiah</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>In the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin the king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>David’s house was told, “Syria is allied with Ephraim.” His heart trembled, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Then the LORD said to Isaiah, “Go out now to meet Ahaz, you, and Shearjashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, on the highway of the fuller’s field.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Tell him, ‘Be careful, and keep calm. Don’t be afraid, neither let your heart be faint because of these two tails of smoking torches, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have plotted evil against you, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>“Let’s go up against Judah, and tear it apart, and let’s divide it among ourselves, and set up a king within it, even the son of Tabeel.”   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>This is what the Lord GOD says: “It shall not stand, neither shall it happen.”   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. Within sixty-five years Ephraim shall be broken in pieces, so that it shall not be a people.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah’s son. If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established.’ ”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>The LORD spoke again to Ahaz, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>“Ask a sign of the LORD your God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>But Ahaz said, “I won’t ask. I won’t tempt the LORD.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>He said, “Listen now, house of David. Is it not enough for you to try the patience of men, that you will try the patience of my God also?   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin will conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="isa-7-14-note-1">
