    <h1>The Proverbs</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
    
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>A wise son listens to his father’s instruction,<br/>but a scoffer doesn’t listen to rebuke.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>By the fruit of his lips, a man enjoys good things,<br/>but the unfaithful crave violence.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>He who guards his mouth guards his soul.<br/>One who opens wide his lips comes to ruin.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>The soul of the sluggard desires, and has nothing,<br/>but the desire of the diligent shall be fully satisfied.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>A righteous man hates lies,<br/>but a wicked man brings shame and disgrace.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Righteousness guards the way of integrity,<br/>but wickedness overthrows the sinner.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>There are some who pretend to be rich, yet have nothing.<br/>There are some who pretend to be poor, yet have great wealth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>The ransom of a man’s life is his riches,<br/>but the poor hear no threats.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>The light of the righteous shines brightly,<br/>but the lamp of the wicked is snuffed out.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Pride only breeds quarrels,<br/>but wisdom is with people who take advice.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Wealth gained dishonestly dwindles away,<br/>but he who gathers by hand makes it grow.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Hope deferred makes the heart sick,<br/>but when longing is fulfilled, it is a tree of life.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Whoever despises instruction will pay for it,<br/>but he who respects a command will be rewarded.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>The teaching of the wise is a spring of life,<br/>to turn from the snares of death.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Good understanding wins favor,<br/>but the way of the unfaithful is hard.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Every prudent man acts from knowledge,<br/>but a fool exposes folly.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>A wicked messenger falls into trouble,<br/>but a trustworthy envoy gains healing.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Poverty and shame come to him who refuses discipline,<br/>but he who heeds correction shall be honored.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Longing fulfilled is sweet to the soul,<br/>but fools detest turning from evil.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>One who walks with wise men grows wise,<br/>but a companion of fools suffers harm.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Misfortune pursues sinners,<br/>but prosperity rewards the righteous.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children,<br/>but the wealth of the sinner is stored for the righteous.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>An abundance of food is in poor people’s fields,<br/>but injustice sweeps it away.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>One who spares the rod hates his son,<br/>but one who loves him is careful to discipline him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>The righteous one eats to the satisfying of his soul,<br/>but the belly of the wicked goes hungry.</p></blockquote></section>
