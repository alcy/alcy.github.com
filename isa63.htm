    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Who is this who comes from Edom,<br/>with dyed garments from Bozrah?<br/>Who is this who is glorious in his clothing,<br/>marching in the greatness of his strength?<br/>“It is I who speak in righteousness,<br/>mighty to save.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Why is your clothing red,<br/>and your garments like him who treads in the wine vat?<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>“I have trodden the wine press alone.<br/>Of the peoples, no one was with me.<br/>Yes, I trod them in my anger<br/>and trampled them in my wrath.<br/>Their lifeblood is sprinkled on my garments,<br/>and I have stained all my clothing.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>For the day of vengeance was in my heart,<br/>and the year of my redeemed has come.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>I looked, and there was no one to help;<br/>and I wondered that there was no one to uphold.<br/>Therefore my own arm brought salvation to me.<br/>My own wrath upheld me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>I trod down the peoples in my anger<br/>and made them drunk in my wrath.<br/>I poured their lifeblood out on the earth.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>I will tell of the loving kindnesses of the LORD<br/>and the praises of the LORD,<br/>according to all that the LORD has given to us,<br/>and the great goodness toward the house of Israel,<br/>which he has given to them according to his mercies,<br/>and according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>For he said, “Surely, they are my people,<br/>children who will not deal falsely;”<br/>so he became their Savior.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>In all their affliction he was afflicted,<br/>and the angel of his presence saved them.<br/>In his love and in his pity he redeemed them.<br/>He bore them,<br/>and carried them all the days of old.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>But they rebelled<br/>and grieved his Holy Spirit.<br/>Therefore he turned and became their enemy,<br/>and he himself fought against them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Then he remembered the days of old,<br/>Moses and his people, saying,<br/>“Where is he who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock?<br/>Where is he who put his Holy Spirit among them?”<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Who caused his glorious arm to be at Moses’ right hand?<br/>Who divided the waters before them, to make himself an everlasting name?<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Who led them through the depths,<br/>like a horse in the wilderness,<br/>so that they didn’t stumble?<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>As the livestock that go down into the valley,<br/>the LORD’s Spirit caused them to rest.<br/>So you led your people to make yourself a glorious name.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Look down from heaven,<br/>and see from the habitation of your holiness and of your glory.<br/>Where are your zeal and your mighty acts?<br/>The yearning of your heart and your compassion is restrained toward me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>For you are our Father,<br/>though Abraham doesn’t know us,<br/>and Israel does not acknowledge us.<br/>You, LORD, are our Father.<br/>Our Redeemer from everlasting is your name.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>O LORD, why do you make us wander from your ways,<br/>and harden our heart from your fear?<br/>Return for your servants’ sake,<br/>the tribes of your inheritance.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Your holy people possessed it but a little while.<br/>Our adversaries have trodden down your sanctuary.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>We have become like those over whom you never ruled,<br/>like those who were not called by your name.</p></blockquote></section>
