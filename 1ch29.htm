        a daric was a gold coin issued by a Persian king, weighing about 8.4 grams or about 0.27 troy ounces each.

For all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, LORD, and you are exalted as head above all.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Both riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all! In your hand is power and might! It is in your hand to make great, and to give strength to all!   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Now therefore, our God, we thank you and praise your glorious name.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly as this? For all things come from you, and we have given you of your own.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>For we are strangers before you and foreigners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no remaining.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes from your hand, and is all your own.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>I know also, my God, that you try the heart and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things. Now I have seen with joy your people, who are present here, offer willingly to you.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>LORD, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this desire forever in the thoughts of the heart of your people, and prepare their heart for you;   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>and give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made provision.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Then David said to all the assembly, “Now bless the LORD your God!”</p><p>All the assembly blessed the LORD, the God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads and prostrated themselves before the LORD and the king.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>They sacrificed sacrifices to the LORD and offered burnt offerings to the LORD on the next day after that day, even one thousand bulls, one thousand rams, and one thousand lambs, with their drink offerings and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel,   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>and ate and drank before the LORD on that day with great gladness. They made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him before the LORD to be prince, and Zadok to be priest.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>All the princes, the mighty men, and also all of the sons of King David submitted themselves to Solomon the king.   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>The LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and gave to him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V27"></span>The time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V28"></span>He died at a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor; and Solomon his son reigned in his place.   <span class="verse" id="V29"></span>Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer,   <span class="verse" id="V30"></span>with all his reign and his might, and the events that involved him, Israel, and all the kingdoms of the lands.</p></section>
