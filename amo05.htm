    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Listen to this word which I take up for a lamentation over you, O house of Israel:</p><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>“The virgin of Israel has fallen;<br/>She shall rise no more.<br/>She is cast down on her land;<br/>there is no one to raise her up.”</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For the Lord GOD says:</p><blockquote><p>“The city that went out a thousand shall have a hundred left,<br/>and that which went out one hundred shall have ten left to the house of Israel.”</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>For the LORD says to the house of Israel:</p><blockquote><p>“Seek me, and you will live;<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>but don’t seek Bethel,<br/>nor enter into Gilgal,<br/>and don’t pass to Beersheba;<br/>for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity,<br/>and Bethel shall come to nothing.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Seek the LORD, and you will live,<br/>lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph,<br/>and it devour, and there be no one to quench it in Bethel.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>You who turn justice to wormwood,<br/>and cast down righteousness to the earth!<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Seek him who made the Pleiades and Orion,<br/>and turns the shadow of death into the morning,<br/>and makes the day dark with night;<br/>who calls for the waters of the sea,<br/>and pours them out on the surface of the earth, the LORD is his name,<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>who brings sudden destruction on the strong,<br/>so that destruction comes on the fortress.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>They hate him who reproves in the gate,<br/>and they abhor him who speaks blamelessly.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Therefore, because you trample on the poor and take taxes from him of wheat,<br/>you have built houses of cut stone, but you will not dwell in them.<br/>You have planted pleasant vineyards,<br/>but you shall not drink their wine.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>For I know how many are your offenses,<br/>and how great are your sins—<br/>you who afflict the just,<br/>who take a bribe,<br/>and who turn away the needy in the courts.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Therefore a prudent person keeps silent in such a time,<br/>for it is an evil time.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Seek good, and not evil,<br/>that you may live;<br/>and so the LORD, the God of Armies, will be with you,<br/>as you say.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Hate evil, love good,<br/>and establish justice in the courts.<br/>It may be that the LORD, the God of Armies, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.”</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Therefore the LORD, the God of Armies, the Lord, says:</p><blockquote><p>“Wailing will be in all the wide ways.<br/>They will say in all the streets, ‘Alas! Alas!’<br/>They will call the farmer to mourning,<br/>and those who are skillful in lamentation to wailing.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>In all vineyards there will be wailing,<br/>for I will pass through the middle of you,” says the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>“Woe to you who desire the day of the LORD!<br/>Why do you long for the day of the LORD?<br/>It is darkness,<br/>and not light.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>As if a man fled from a lion,<br/>and a bear met him;<br/>or he went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall,<br/>and a snake bit him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Won’t the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light?<br/>Even very dark, and no brightness in it?<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>I hate, I despise your feasts,<br/>and I can’t stand your solemn assemblies.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Yes, though you offer me your burnt offerings and meal offerings,<br/>I will not accept them;<br/>neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat animals.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Take away from me the noise of your songs!<br/>I will not listen to the music of your harps.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>But let justice roll on like rivers,<br/>and righteousness like a mighty stream.</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>“Did you bring to me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, house of Israel?   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>You also carried the tent of your king and the shrine of your images, the star of your god, which you made for yourselves.   <span class="verse" id="V27"></span>Therefore I will cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus,” says the LORD, whose name is the God of Armies. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="amo06.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
