    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, the LORD’s word came to me, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>“Son of man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt, and tell him,</p><blockquote><p>‘You were likened to a young lion of the nations;<br/>yet you are as a monster in the seas.<br/>You broke out with your rivers,<br/>and troubled the waters with your feet,<br/>and fouled their rivers.’ ”<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>The Lord GOD says:<br/>“I will spread out my net on you with a company of many peoples.<br/>They will bring you up in my net.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>I will leave you on the land.<br/>I will cast you out on the open field,<br/>and will cause all the birds of the sky to settle on you.<br/>I will satisfy the animals of the whole earth with you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>I will lay your flesh on the mountains,<br/>and fill the valleys with your height.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>I will also water the land in which you swim with your blood,<br/>even to the mountains.<br/>The watercourses will be full of you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>When I extinguish you, I will cover the heavens<br/>and make its stars dark.<br/>I will cover the sun with a cloud,<br/>and the moon won’t give its light.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>I will make all the bright lights of the sky dark over you,<br/>and set darkness on your land,” says the Lord GOD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>“I will also trouble the hearts of many peoples,<br/>when I bring your destruction among the nations,<br/>into the countries which you have not known.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Yes, I will make many peoples amazed at you,<br/>and their kings will be horribly afraid for you,<br/>when I brandish my sword before them.<br/>They will tremble at every moment,<br/>every man for his own life,<br/>in the day of your fall.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>For the Lord GOD says:<br/>“The sword of the king of Babylon will come on you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>I will cause your multitude to fall by the swords of the mighty.<br/>They are all the ruthless of the nations.<br/>They will bring the pride of Egypt to nothing,<br/>and all its multitude will be destroyed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>I will destroy also all its animals from beside many waters.<br/>The foot of man won’t trouble them any more,<br/>nor will the hoofs of animals trouble them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Then I will make their waters clear,<br/>and cause their rivers to run like oil,”<br/>says the Lord GOD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>“When I make the land of Egypt desolate and waste,<br/>a land destitute of that of which it was full,<br/>when I strike all those who dwell therein,<br/>then they will know that I am the LORD.</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>“ ‘ “This is the lamentation with which they will lament. The daughters of the nations will lament with this. They will lament with it over Egypt, and over all her multitude,” says the Lord GOD.’ ”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, the LORD’s word came to me, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>“Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her and the daughters of the famous nations, to the lower parts of the earth, with those who go down into the pit.   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Whom do you pass in beauty? Go down, and be laid with the uncircumcised.   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>They will fall among those who are slain by the sword. She is delivered to the sword.

Her graves are around her, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for their terror was caused in the land of the living, and they have borne their shame with those who go down to the pit. He is put among those who are slain.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>“There is Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitude.
