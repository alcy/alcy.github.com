    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,</p><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>“Can a man be profitable to God?<br/>Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that you are righteous?<br/>Or does it benefit him that you make your ways perfect?<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Is it for your piety that he reproves you,<br/>that he enters with you into judgment?<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Isn’t your wickedness great?<br/>Neither is there any end to your iniquities.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>For you have taken pledges from your brother for nothing,<br/>and stripped the naked of their clothing.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>You haven’t given water to the weary to drink,<br/>and you have withheld bread from the hungry.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>But as for the mighty man, he had the earth.<br/>The honorable man, he lived in it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>You have sent widows away empty,<br/>and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Therefore snares are around you.<br/>Sudden fear troubles you,<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>or darkness, so that you can not see,<br/>and floods of waters cover you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>“Isn’t God in the heights of heaven?<br/>See the height of the stars, how high they are!<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>You say, ‘What does God know?<br/>Can he judge through the thick darkness?<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he doesn’t see.<br/>He walks on the vault of the sky.’<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Will you keep the old way,<br/>which wicked men have trodden,<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>who were snatched away before their time,<br/>whose foundation was poured out as a stream,<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>who said to God, ‘Depart from us!’<br/>and, ‘What can the Almighty do for us?’<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Yet he filled their houses with good things,<br/>but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>The righteous see it, and are glad.<br/>The innocent ridicule them,<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>saying, ‘Surely those who rose up against us are cut off.<br/>The fire has consumed their remnant.’<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>“Acquaint yourself with him now, and be at peace.<br/>By it, good will come to you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Please receive instruction from his mouth,<br/>and lay up his words in your heart.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up,<br/>if you put away unrighteousness far from your tents.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Lay your treasure in the dust,<br/>the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>The Almighty will be your treasure,<br/>and precious silver to you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty,<br/>and will lift up your face to God.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>You will make your prayer to him, and he will hear you.<br/>You will pay your vows.<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>You will also decree a thing, and it will be established to you.<br/>Light will shine on your ways.<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>When they cast down, you will say, ‘be lifted up.’<br/>He will save the humble person.<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>He will even deliver him who is not innocent.<br/>Yes, he will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.”</p></blockquote></section>
