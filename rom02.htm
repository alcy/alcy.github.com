    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Therefore you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are who judge. For in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you who judge practice the same things.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Do you think this, O man who judges those who practice such things, and do the same, that you will escape the judgment of God?   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Or do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath, revelation, and of the righteous judgment of God,   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>who “will pay back to everyone according to their works:”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="rom-2-6-note-1">

</span> <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>to those who by perseverance in well-doing seek for glory, honor, and incorruptibility, eternal life;   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>but to those who are self-seeking and don’t obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will be wrath, indignation,   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>oppression, and anguish on every soul of man who does evil, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>But glory, honor, and peace go to every man who does good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>For there is no partiality with God.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>For as many as have sinned without the law will also perish without the law. As many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>For it isn’t the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>(for when Gentiles who don’t have the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are a law to themselves,   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying with them, and their thoughts among themselves accusing or else excusing them)   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>in the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my Good News, by Jesus Christ.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Indeed you bear the name of a Jew, rest on the law, glory in God,   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>know his will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babies, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>You therefore who teach another, don’t you teach yourself? You who preach that a man shouldn’t steal, do you steal?   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>You who say a man shouldn’t commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>You who glory in the law, do you dishonor God by disobeying the law?   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>For “the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="rom-2-24-note-1">

</span> just as it is written.   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>For circumcision indeed profits, if you are a doer of the law, but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>If therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law, won’t his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision?   <span class="verse" id="V27"></span>Won’t those who are physically uncircumcised, but fulfill the law, judge you, who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law?   <span class="verse" id="V28"></span>For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh;   <span class="verse" id="V29"></span>but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.</p></section>
