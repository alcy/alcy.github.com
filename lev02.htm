He shall pour oil on it, and put frankincense on it.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>He shall bring it to Aaron’s sons, the priests. He shall take his handful of its fine flour, and of its oil, with all its frankincense, and the priest shall burn its memorial on the altar, an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>That which is left of the meal offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’. It is a most holy part of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>“ ‘When you offer an offering of a meal offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>If your offering is a meal offering made on a griddle, it shall be of unleavened fine flour, mixed with oil.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>You shall cut it in pieces, and pour oil on it. It is a meal offering.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>If your offering is a meal offering of the pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>You shall bring the meal offering that is made of these things to the LORD. It shall be presented to the priest, and he shall bring it to the altar.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>The priest shall take from the meal offering its memorial, and shall burn it on the altar, an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>That which is left of the meal offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’. It is a most holy part of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>“ ‘No meal offering which you shall offer to the LORD shall be made with yeast; for you shall burn no yeast, nor any honey, as an offering made by fire to the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>As an offering of first fruits you shall offer them to the LORD, but they shall not rise up as a pleasant aroma on the altar.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Every offering of your meal offering you shall season with salt.
