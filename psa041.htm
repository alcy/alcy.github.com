    <h1>Psalm 41</h1>

    <p class="psalm-subtitle">For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Blessed is he who considers the poor.<br/>The LORD will deliver him in the day of evil.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive.<br/>He shall be blessed on the earth,<br/>and he will not surrender him to the will of his enemies.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>The LORD will sustain him on his sickbed,<br/>and restore him from his bed of illness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>I said, “LORD, have mercy on me!<br/>Heal me, for I have sinned against you.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>My enemies speak evil against me:<br/>“When will he die, and his name perish?”<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>If he comes to see me, he speaks falsehood.<br/>His heart gathers iniquity to itself.<br/>When he goes abroad, he tells it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>All who hate me whisper together against me.<br/>They imagine the worst for me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>“An evil disease”, they say, “has afflicted him.<br/>Now that he lies he shall rise up no more.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Yes, my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted,<br/>who ate bread with me,<br/>has lifted up his heel against me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>But you, LORD, have mercy on me, and raise me up,<br/>that I may repay them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>By this I know that you delight in me,<br/>because my enemy doesn’t triumph over me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>As for me, you uphold me in my integrity,<br/>and set me in your presence forever.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,<br/>from everlasting and to everlasting!<br/>Amen and amen.</p></blockquote></section>
