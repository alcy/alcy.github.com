            “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.
            </span> you are beautiful, my love.<br/>Behold, you are beautiful.<br/>Your eyes are like doves.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved, yes, pleasant;<br/>and our couch is verdant.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>The beams of our house are cedars.<br/>Our rafters are firs.</p></blockquote></section>
