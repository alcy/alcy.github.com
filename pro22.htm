    <h2>Chapter 22</h2>
    
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>A good name is more desirable than great riches,<br/>and loving favor is better than silver and gold.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>The rich and the poor have this in common:<br/>The LORD is the maker of them all.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>A prudent man sees danger and hides himself;<br/>but the simple pass on, and suffer for it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>The result of humility and the fear of the LORD<br/>is wealth, honor, and life.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Thorns and snares are in the path of the wicked;<br/>whoever guards his soul stays far from them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Train up a child in the way he should go,<br/>and when he is old he will not depart from it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>The rich rule over the poor.<br/>The borrower is servant to the lender.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>He who sows wickedness reaps trouble,<br/>and the rod of his fury will be destroyed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>He who has a generous eye will be blessed,<br/>for he shares his food with the poor.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Drive out the mocker, and strife will go out;<br/>yes, quarrels and insults will stop.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>He who loves purity of heart and speaks gracefully<br/>is the king’s friend.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>The LORD’s eyes watch over knowledge,<br/>but he frustrates the words of the unfaithful.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>The sluggard says, “There is a lion outside!<br/>I will be killed in the streets!”<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit.<br/>He who is under the LORD’s wrath will fall into it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Folly is bound up in the heart of a child;<br/>the rod of discipline drives it far from him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Whoever oppresses the poor for his own increase and whoever gives to the rich,<br/>both come to poverty.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Turn your ear, and listen to the words of the wise.<br/>Apply your heart to my teaching.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you,<br/>if all of them are ready on your lips.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>I teach you today, even you,<br/>so that your trust may be in the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Haven’t I written to you thirty excellent things<br/>of counsel and knowledge,<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>To teach you truth, reliable words,<br/>to give sound answers to the ones who sent you?<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Don’t exploit the poor because he is poor;<br/>and don’t crush the needy in court;<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>for the LORD will plead their case,<br/>and plunder the life of those who plunder them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Don’t befriend a hot-tempered man.<br/>Don’t associate with one who harbors anger,<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>lest you learn his ways<br/>and ensnare your soul.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>Don’t you be one of those who strike hands,<br/>of those who are collateral for debts.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>If you don’t have means to pay,<br/>why should he take away your bed from under you?<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>Don’t move the ancient boundary stone<br/>which your fathers have set up.<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>Do you see a man skilled in his work?<br/>He will serve kings.<br/>He won’t serve obscure men.</p></blockquote></section>
