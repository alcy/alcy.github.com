    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Doesn’t wisdom cry out?<br/>Doesn’t understanding raise her voice?<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>On the top of high places by the way,<br/>where the paths meet, she stands.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Beside the gates, at the entry of the city,<br/>at the entry doors, she cries aloud:<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>“I call to you men!<br/>I send my voice to the sons of mankind.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>You simple, understand prudence!<br/>You fools, be of an understanding heart!<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Hear, for I will speak excellent things.<br/>The opening of my lips is for right things.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>For my mouth speaks truth.<br/>Wickedness is an abomination to my lips.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>All the words of my mouth are in righteousness.<br/>There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>They are all plain to him who understands,<br/>right to those who find knowledge.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Receive my instruction rather than silver,<br/>knowledge rather than choice gold.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>For wisdom is better than rubies.<br/>All the things that may be desired can’t be compared to it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>“I, wisdom, have made prudence my dwelling.<br/>Find out knowledge and discretion.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>The fear of the LORD is to hate evil.<br/>I hate pride, arrogance, the evil way, and the perverse mouth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Counsel and sound knowledge are mine.<br/>I have understanding and power.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>By me kings reign,<br/>and princes decree justice.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>By me princes rule,<br/>nobles, and all the righteous rulers of the earth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>I love those who love me.<br/>Those who seek me diligently will find me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>With me are riches, honor,<br/>enduring wealth, and prosperity.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>My fruit is better than gold, yes, than fine gold,<br/>my yield than choice silver.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>I walk in the way of righteousness,<br/>in the middle of the paths of justice,<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>that I may give wealth to those who love me.<br/>I fill their treasuries.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>“The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his work,<br/>before his deeds of old.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning,<br/>before the earth existed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>When there were no depths, I was born,<br/>when there were no springs abounding with water.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>Before the mountains were settled in place,<br/>before the hills, I was born;<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields,<br/>nor the beginning of the dust of the world.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>When he established the heavens, I was there.<br/>When he set a circle on the surface of the deep,<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>when he established the clouds above,<br/>when the springs of the deep became strong,<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>when he gave to the sea its boundary,<br/>that the waters should not violate his commandment,<br/>when he marked out the foundations of the earth,<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>then I was the craftsman by his side.<br/>I was a delight day by day,<br/>always rejoicing before him,<br/><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>rejoicing in his whole world.<br/>My delight was with the sons of men.<br/><span class="verse" id="V32"></span>“Now therefore, my sons, listen to me,<br/>for blessed are those who keep my ways.<br/><span class="verse" id="V33"></span>Hear instruction, and be wise.<br/>Don’t refuse it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V34"></span>Blessed is the man who hears me,<br/>watching daily at my gates,<br/>waiting at my door posts.<br/><span class="verse" id="V35"></span>For whoever finds me finds life,<br/>and will obtain favor from the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V36"></span>But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul.<br/>All those who hate me love death.”</p></blockquote></section>
