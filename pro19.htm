    <h1>The Proverbs</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 19</h2>
    
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Better is the poor who walks in his integrity<br/>than he who is perverse in his lips and is a fool.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>It isn’t good to have zeal without knowledge,<br/>nor being hasty with one’s feet and missing the way.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>The foolishness of man subverts his way;<br/>his heart rages against the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Wealth adds many friends,<br/>but the poor is separated from his friend.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>A false witness shall not be unpunished.<br/>He who pours out lies shall not go free.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Many will entreat the favor of a ruler,<br/>and everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>All the relatives of the poor shun him;<br/>how much more do his friends avoid him!<br/>He pursues them with pleas, but they are gone.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>He who gets wisdom loves his own soul.<br/>He who keeps understanding shall find good.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>A false witness shall not be unpunished.<br/>He who utters lies shall perish.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Delicate living is not appropriate for a fool,<br/>much less for a servant to have rule over princes.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger.<br/>It is his glory to overlook an offense.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>The king’s wrath is like the roaring of a lion,<br/>but his favor is like dew on the grass.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>A foolish son is the calamity of his father.<br/>A wife’s quarrels are a continual dripping.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>House and riches are an inheritance from fathers,<br/>but a prudent wife is from the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep.<br/>The idle soul shall suffer hunger.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul,<br/>but he who is contemptuous in his ways shall die.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>He who has pity on the poor lends to the LORD;<br/>he will reward him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Discipline your son, for there is hope;<br/>don’t be a willing party to his death.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>A hot-tempered man must pay the penalty,<br/>for if you rescue him, you must do it again.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Listen to counsel and receive instruction,<br/>that you may be wise in your latter end.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>There are many plans in a man’s heart,<br/>but the LORD’s counsel will prevail.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>That which makes a man to be desired is his kindness.<br/>A poor man is better than a liar.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>The fear of the LORD leads to life, then contentment;<br/>he rests and will not be touched by trouble.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>The sluggard buries his hand in the dish;<br/>he will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>Flog a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence;<br/>rebuke one who has understanding, and he will gain knowledge.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>He who robs his father and drives away his mother<br/>is a son who causes shame and brings reproach.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>If you stop listening to instruction, my son,<br/>you will stray from the words of knowledge.<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>A corrupt witness mocks justice,<br/>and the mouth of the wicked gulps down iniquity.<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>Penalties are prepared for scoffers,<br/>and beatings for the backs of fools.</p></blockquote></section>
