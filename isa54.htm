    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>“Sing, barren, you who didn’t give birth!<br/>Break out into singing, and cry aloud, you who didn’t travail with child!<br/>For more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife,” says the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>“Enlarge the place of your tent,<br/>and let them stretch out the curtains of your habitations;<br/>don’t spare; lengthen your cords, and strengthen your stakes.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For you will spread out on the right hand and on the left;<br/>and your offspring will possess the nations<br/>and settle in desolate cities.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>“Don’t be afraid, for you will not be ashamed.<br/>Don’t be confounded, for you will not be disappointed.<br/>For you will forget the shame of your youth.<br/>You will remember the reproach of your widowhood no more.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>For your Maker is your husband; the LORD of Armies is his name.<br/>The Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer.<br/>He will be called the God of the whole earth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>For the LORD has called you as a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit,<br/>even a wife of youth, when she is cast off,” says your God.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>“For a small moment I have forsaken you,<br/>but I will gather you with great mercies.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>In overflowing wrath I hid my face from you for a moment,<br/>but with everlasting loving kindness I will have mercy on you,” says the LORD your Redeemer.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>“For this is like the waters of Noah to me;<br/>for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah will no more go over the earth,<br/>so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you, nor rebuke you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>For the mountains may depart,<br/>and the hills be removed,<br/>but my loving kindness will not depart from you,<br/>and my covenant of peace will not be removed,”<br/>says the LORD who has mercy on you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>“You afflicted, tossed with storms, and not comforted,<br/>behold, I will set your stones in beautiful colors,<br/>and lay your foundations with sapphires.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>I will make your pinnacles of rubies,<br/>your gates of sparkling jewels,<br/>and all your walls of precious stones.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>All your children will be taught by the LORD,<br/>and your children’s peace will be great.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>You will be established in righteousness.<br/>You will be far from oppression,<br/>for you will not be afraid,<br/>and far from terror,<br/>for it shall not come near you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Behold, they may gather together, but not by me.<br/>Whoever gathers together against you will fall because of you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>“Behold, I have created the blacksmith who fans the coals into flame,<br/>and forges a weapon for his work;<br/>and I have created the destroyer to destroy.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>No weapon that is formed against you will prevail;<br/>and you will condemn every tongue that rises against you in judgment.<br/>This is the heritage of the LORD’s servants,<br/>and their righteousness is of me,” says the LORD. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="isa55.htm">→</a></span></p></blockquote></section>
