Every branch that bears fruit, he prunes, that it may bear more fruit. </span> <span class="verse" id="V3"></span><span class="wj">You are already pruned clean because of the word which I have spoken to you. </span> <span class="verse" id="V4"></span><span class="wj">Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch can’t bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in me. </span> <span class="verse" id="V5"></span><span class="wj">I am the vine. You are the branches. He who remains in me and I in him bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. </span> <span class="verse" id="V6"></span><span class="wj">If a man doesn’t remain in me, he is thrown out as a branch and is withered; and they gather them, throw them into the fire, and they are burned. </span> <span class="verse" id="V7"></span><span class="wj">If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, you will ask whatever you desire, and it will be done for you.</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V8"></span><span class="wj">“In this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; and so you will be my disciples. </span> <span class="verse" id="V9"></span><span class="wj">Even as the Father has loved me, I also have loved you. Remain in my love. </span> <span class="verse" id="V10"></span><span class="wj">If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love, even as I have kept my Father’s commandments and remain in his love. </span> <span class="verse" id="V11"></span><span class="wj">I have spoken these things to you, that my joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be made full.</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span><span class="wj">“This is my commandment, that you love one another, even as I have loved you. </span> <span class="verse" id="V13"></span><span class="wj">Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends. </span> <span class="verse" id="V14"></span><span class="wj">You are my friends if you do whatever I command you. </span> <span class="verse" id="V15"></span><span class="wj">No longer do I call you servants, for the servant doesn’t know what his lord does. But I have called you friends, for everything that I heard from my Father, I have made known to you. </span> <span class="verse" id="V16"></span><span class="wj">You didn’t choose me, but I chose you and appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you will ask of the Father in my name, he may give it to you.</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span><span class="wj">“I command these things to you, that you may love one another. </span> <span class="verse" id="V18"></span><span class="wj">If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you. </span> <span class="verse" id="V19"></span><span class="wj">If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, since I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. </span> <span class="verse" id="V20"></span><span class="wj">Remember the word that I said to you: ‘A servant is not greater than his lord.’</span><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="jhn-15-20-note-1">
