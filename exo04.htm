The water which you take out of the river will become blood on the dry land.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Moses said to the LORD, “O Lord,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="exo-4-10-note-1">

        The word translated “Lord” is “Adonai”.
        </span> I am not eloquent, neither before now, nor since you have spoken to your servant; for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>The LORD said to him, “Who made man’s mouth? Or who makes one mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Isn’t it I, the LORD?   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth, and teach you what you shall speak.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Moses said, “Oh, Lord, please send someone else.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>The LORD’s anger burned against Moses, and he said, “What about Aaron, your brother, the Levite? I know that he can speak well. Also, behold, he is coming out to meet you. When he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>You shall speak to him, and put the words in his mouth. I will be with your mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>He will be your spokesman to the people. It will happen that he will be to you a mouth, and you will be to him as God.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>You shall take this rod in your hand, with which you shall do the signs.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, “Please let me go and return to my brothers who are in Egypt, and see whether they are still alive.”</p><p>Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>The LORD said to Moses in Midian, “Go, return into Egypt; for all the men who sought your life are dead.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them on a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt. Moses took God’s rod in his hand.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>The LORD said to Moses, “When you go back into Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your hand, but I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go.   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>You shall tell Pharaoh, ‘The LORD says, Israel is my son, my firstborn,   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>and I have said to you, “Let my son go, that he may serve me;” and you have refused to let him go. Behold, I will kill your firstborn son.’ ”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>On the way at a lodging place, the LORD met Moses and wanted to kill him.   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet; and she said, “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>So he let him alone. Then she said, “You are a bridegroom of blood,” because of the circumcision.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>The LORD said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.”</p><p>He went, and met him on God’s mountain, and kissed him.   <span class="verse" id="V28"></span>Moses told Aaron all the LORD’s words with which he had sent him, and all the signs with which he had instructed him.   <span class="verse" id="V29"></span>Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V30"></span>Aaron spoke all the words which the LORD had spoken to Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.   <span class="verse" id="V31"></span>The people believed, and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had seen their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshiped.</p></section>
