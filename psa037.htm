    <h1>Psalm 37</h1>

    <p class="psalm-subtitle">By David.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Don’t fret because of evildoers,<br/>neither be envious against those who work unrighteousness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>For they shall soon be cut down like the grass,<br/>and wither like the green herb.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Trust in the LORD, and do good.<br/>Dwell in the land, and enjoy safe pasture.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Also delight yourself in the LORD,<br/>and he will give you the desires of your heart.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Commit your way to the LORD.<br/>Trust also in him, and he will do this:<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>he will make your righteousness shine out like light,<br/>and your justice as the noon day sun.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him.<br/>Don’t fret because of him who prospers in his way,<br/>because of the man who makes wicked plots happen.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Cease from anger, and forsake wrath.<br/>Don’t fret; it leads only to evildoing.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>For evildoers shall be cut off,<br/>but those who wait for the LORD shall inherit the land.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>For yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more.<br/>Yes, though you look for his place, he isn’t there.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>But the humble shall inherit the land,<br/>and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>The wicked plots against the just,<br/>and gnashes at him with his teeth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>The Lord will laugh at him,<br/>for he sees that his day is coming.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow,<br/>to cast down the poor and needy,<br/>to kill those who are upright on the path.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Their sword shall enter into their own heart.<br/>Their bows shall be broken.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Better is a little that the righteous has,<br/>than the abundance of many wicked.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>For the arms of the wicked shall be broken,<br/>but the LORD upholds the righteous.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>The LORD knows the days of the perfect.<br/>Their inheritance shall be forever.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>They shall not be disappointed in the time of evil.<br/>In the days of famine they shall be satisfied.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>But the wicked shall perish.<br/>The enemies of the LORD shall be like the beauty of the fields.<br/>They will vanish—<br/>vanish like smoke.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>The wicked borrow, and don’t pay back,<br/>but the righteous give generously.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>For such as are blessed by him shall inherit the land.<br/>Those who are cursed by him shall be cut off.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>A man’s steps are established by the LORD.<br/>He delights in his way.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Though he stumble, he shall not fall,<br/>for the LORD holds him up with his hand.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>I have been young, and now am old,<br/>yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken,<br/>nor his children begging for bread.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>All day long he deals graciously, and lends.<br/>His offspring is blessed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>Depart from evil, and do good.<br/>Live securely forever.<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>For the LORD loves justice,<br/>and doesn’t forsake his saints.<br/>They are preserved forever,<br/>but the children of the wicked shall be cut off.<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>The righteous shall inherit the land,<br/>and live in it forever.<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>The mouth of the righteous talks of wisdom.<br/>His tongue speaks justice.<br/><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>The law of his God is in his heart.<br/>None of his steps shall slide.<br/><span class="verse" id="V32"></span>The wicked watch the righteous,<br/>and seek to kill him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V33"></span>The LORD will not leave him in his hand,<br/>nor condemn him when he is judged.<br/><span class="verse" id="V34"></span>Wait for the LORD, and keep his way,<br/>and he will exalt you to inherit the land.<br/>When the wicked are cut off, you shall see it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V35"></span>I have seen the wicked in great power,<br/>spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil.<br/><span class="verse" id="V36"></span>But he passed away, and behold, he was not.<br/>Yes, I sought him, but he could not be found.<br/><span class="verse" id="V37"></span>Mark the perfect man, and see the upright,<br/>for there is a future for the man of peace.<br/><span class="verse" id="V38"></span>As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together.<br/>The future of the wicked shall be cut off.<br/><span class="verse" id="V39"></span>But the salvation of the righteous is from the LORD.<br/>He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.<br/><span class="verse" id="V40"></span>The LORD helps them and rescues them.<br/>He rescues them from the wicked and saves them,<br/>because they have taken refuge in him.</p></blockquote></section>
