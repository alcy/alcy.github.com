            “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה” or “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.

But if when you do well, you patiently endure suffering, this is commendable with God.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>For you were called to this, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="1pe-2-21-note-1">
