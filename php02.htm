    <h1>Paul's Letter to the Philippians</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>If therefore there is any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassion,   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>make my joy full by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>doing nothing through rivalry or through conceit, but in humility, each counting others better than himself;   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>each of you not just looking to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Have this in your mind, which was also in Christ Jesus,   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>who, existing in the form of God, didn’t consider equality with God a thing to be grasped,   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>And being found in human form, he humbled himself, becoming obedient to the point of death, yes, the death of the cross.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Therefore God also highly exalted him, and gave to him the name which is above every name,   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, those on earth, and those under the earth,   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>For it is God who works in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Do all things without complaining and arguing,   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without defect in the middle of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you are seen as lights in the world,   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>holding up the word of life, that I may have something to boast in the day of Christ that I didn’t run in vain nor labor in vain.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Yes, and if I am poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>In the same way, you also should be glad and rejoice with me.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered up when I know how you are doing.   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>For I have no one else like-minded, who will truly care about you.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>But you know that he has proved himself. As a child serves a father, so he served with me in furtherance of the Good News.   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it will go with me.   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, fellow soldier, and your apostle and servant of my need,   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>since he longed for you all, and was very troubled because you had heard that he was sick.   <span class="verse" id="V27"></span>For indeed he was sick nearly to death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow on sorrow.   <span class="verse" id="V28"></span>I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.   <span class="verse" id="V29"></span>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and hold such people in honor,   <span class="verse" id="V30"></span>because for the work of Christ he came near to death, risking his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.</p></section>
