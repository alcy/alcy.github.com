    <h1>Psalm 28</h1>

    <p class="psalm-subtitle">By David.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>To you, LORD, I call.<br/>My rock, don’t be deaf to me,<br/>lest, if you are silent to me,<br/>I would become like those who go down into the pit.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Hear the voice of my petitions, when I cry to you,<br/>when I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Don’t draw me away with the wicked,<br/>with the workers of iniquity who speak peace with their neighbors,<br/>but mischief is in their hearts.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Give them according to their work, and according to the wickedness of their doings.<br/>Give them according to the operation of their hands.<br/>Bring back on them what they deserve.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Because they don’t respect the works of the LORD,<br/>nor the operation of his hands,<br/>he will break them down and not build them up.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Blessed be the LORD,<br/>because he has heard the voice of my petitions.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>The LORD is my strength and my shield.<br/>My heart has trusted in him, and I am helped.<br/>Therefore my heart greatly rejoices.<br/>With my song I will thank him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>The LORD is their strength.<br/>He is a stronghold of salvation to his anointed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Save your people,<br/>and bless your inheritance.<br/>Be their shepherd also,<br/>and bear them up forever.</p></blockquote></section>
