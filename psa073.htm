    <h1>Psalm 73</h1>

            The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).
            </span> is good to Israel,<br/>to those who are pure in heart.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>But as for me, my feet were almost gone.<br/>My steps had nearly slipped.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For I was envious of the arrogant,<br/>when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>For there are no struggles in their death,<br/>but their strength is firm.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>They are free from burdens of men,<br/>neither are they plagued like other men.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Therefore pride is like a chain around their neck.<br/>Violence covers them like a garment.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Their eyes bulge with fat.<br/>Their minds pass the limits of conceit.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>They scoff and speak with malice.<br/>In arrogance, they threaten oppression.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>They have set their mouth in the heavens.<br/>Their tongue walks through the earth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Therefore their people return to them,<br/>and they drink up waters of abundance.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>They say, “How does God know?<br/>Is there knowledge in the Most High?”<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Behold, these are the wicked.<br/>Being always at ease, they increase in riches.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Surely I have cleansed my heart in vain,<br/>and washed my hands in innocence,<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>For all day long I have been plagued,<br/>and punished every morning.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>If I had said, “I will speak thus”,<br/>behold, I would have betrayed the generation of your children.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>When I tried to understand this,<br/>it was too painful for me—<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>until I entered God’s sanctuary,<br/>and considered their latter end.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Surely you set them in slippery places.<br/>You throw them down to destruction.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>How they are suddenly destroyed!<br/>They are completely swept away with terrors.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>As a dream when one wakes up,<br/>so, Lord,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="psa-73-20-note-1">

            The word translated “Lord” is “Adonai.”

            When rendered in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS, “LORD” or “GOD” is the translation of God’s Proper Name (Hebrew “יהוה”, usually pronounced Yahweh).
