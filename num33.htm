These are their journeys according to their starting points.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>They traveled from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the next day after the Passover, the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians,   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>while the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn, whom the LORD had struck among them.

for I have given the land to you to possess it.   <span class="verse" id="V54"></span>You shall inherit the land by lot according to your families; to the larger groups you shall give a larger inheritance, and to the smaller you shall give a smaller inheritance. Wherever the lot falls to any man, that shall be his. You shall inherit according to the tribes of your fathers.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V55"></span>“But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then those you let remain of them will be like pricks in your eyes and thorns in your sides. They will harass you in the land in which you dwell.   <span class="verse" id="V56"></span>It shall happen that as I thought to do to them, so I will do to you.” <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="num34.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
