    <h2>Chapter 25</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Jokshan became the father of Sheba, and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac,   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>but Abraham gave gifts to the sons of Abraham’s concubines. While he still lived, he sent them away from Isaac his son, eastward, to the east country.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>These are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived: one hundred seventy-five years.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Abraham gave up his spirit, and died at a good old age, an old man, and full of years, and was gathered to his people.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is near Mamre,   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>the field which Abraham purchased from the children of Heth. Abraham was buried there with Sarah, his wife.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>After the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac, his son. Isaac lived by Beer Lahai Roi.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Now this is the history of the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s servant, bore to Abraham.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to the order of their birth: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Mishma, Dumah, Massa,   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments: twelve princes, according to their nations.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>These are the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred thirty-seven years. He gave up his spirit and died, and was gathered to his people.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>They lived from Havilah to Shur that is before Egypt, as you go toward Assyria. He lived opposite all his relatives.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>This is the history of the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son. Abraham became the father of Isaac.   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren. The LORD was entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>The children struggled together within her. She said, “If it is like this, why do I live?” She went to inquire of the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>The LORD said to her,</p><blockquote><p>“Two nations are in your womb.<br/>Two peoples will be separated from your body.<br/>The one people will be stronger than the other people.<br/>The elder will serve the younger.”</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>The first came out red all over, like a hairy garment. They named him Esau.   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>After that, his brother came out, and his hand had hold on Esau’s heel. He was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>The boys grew. Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field. Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents.   <span class="verse" id="V28"></span>Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his venison. Rebekah loved Jacob.   <span class="verse" id="V29"></span>Jacob boiled stew. Esau came in from the field, and he was famished.   <span class="verse" id="V30"></span>Esau said to Jacob, “Please feed me with some of that red stew, for I am famished.” Therefore his name was called Edom.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="gen-25-30-note-1">

        “Edom” means “red”.
        </span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>Jacob said, “First, sell me your birthright.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V32"></span>Esau said, “Behold, I am about to die. What good is the birthright to me?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V33"></span>Jacob said, “Swear to me first.”</p><p>He swore to him. He sold his birthright to Jacob.   <span class="verse" id="V34"></span>Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew. He ate and drank, rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="gen26.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
