    <h1>The Proverbs</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 25</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.</p><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>It is the glory of God to conceal a thing,<br/>but the glory of kings is to search out a matter.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>As the heavens for height, and the earth for depth,<br/>so the hearts of kings are unsearchable.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Take away the dross from the silver,<br/>and material comes out for the refiner.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Take away the wicked from the king’s presence,<br/>and his throne will be established in righteousness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Don’t exalt yourself in the presence of the king,<br/>or claim a place among great men;<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>for it is better that it be said to you, “Come up here,”<br/>than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince,<br/>whom your eyes have seen.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Don’t be hasty in bringing charges to court.<br/>What will you do in the end when your neighbor shames you?<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Debate your case with your neighbor,<br/>and don’t betray the confidence of another,<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>lest one who hears it put you to shame,<br/>and your bad reputation never depart.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>A word fitly spoken<br/>is like apples of gold in settings of silver.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold,<br/>so is a wise reprover to an obedient ear.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>As the cold of snow in the time of harvest,<br/>so is a faithful messenger to those who send him;<br/>for he refreshes the soul of his masters.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>As clouds and wind without rain,<br/>so is he who boasts of gifts deceptively.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>By patience a ruler is persuaded.<br/>A soft tongue breaks the bone.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Have you found honey?<br/>Eat as much as is sufficient for you,<br/>lest you eat too much, and vomit it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house,<br/>lest he be weary of you, and hate you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>A man who gives false testimony against his neighbor<br/>is like a club, a sword, or a sharp arrow.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Confidence in someone unfaithful in time of trouble<br/>is like a bad tooth or a lame foot.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>As one who takes away a garment in cold weather,<br/>or vinegar on soda,<br/>so is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat.<br/>If he is thirsty, give him water to drink;<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>for you will heap coals of fire on his head,<br/>and the LORD will reward you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>The north wind produces rain;<br/>so a backbiting tongue brings an angry face.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop<br/>than to share a house with a contentious woman.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>Like cold water to a thirsty soul,<br/>so is good news from a far country.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>Like a muddied spring and a polluted well,<br/>so is a righteous man who gives way before the wicked.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>It is not good to eat much honey,<br/>nor is it honorable to seek one’s own honor.<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>Like a city that is broken down and without walls<br/>is a man whose spirit is without restraint.</p></blockquote></section>
