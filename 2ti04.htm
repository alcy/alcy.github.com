    <h1>Paul's Second Letter to Timothy</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom:   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort with all patience and teaching.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts,   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn away to fables.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>From now on, the crown of righteousness is stored up for me, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Be diligent to come to me soon,   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia; and Titus to Dalmatia.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come—and the books, especially the parchments.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Alexander the coppersmith did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his deeds.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Beware of him, for he greatly opposed our words.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear. So I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="tit01.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
