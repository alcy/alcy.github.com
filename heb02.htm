    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Therefore we ought to pay greater attention to the things that were heard, lest perhaps we drift away.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just penalty,   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation—which at the first having been spoken through the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard,   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders, by various works of power, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will?</p><p><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>For he didn’t subject the world to come, of which we speak, to angels.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>But one has somewhere testified, saying,</p><blockquote><p>“What is man, that you think of him?<br/>Or the son of man, that you care for him?<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>You made him a little lower than the angels.<br/>You crowned him with glory and honor.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="heb-2-7-note-1">

</span></p></blockquote><p>For in that he subjected all things to him, he left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we don’t yet see all things subjected to him.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>But we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by the grace of God he should taste of death for everyone.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>For it became him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in bringing many children to glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>For both he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="heb-2-11-note-1">
