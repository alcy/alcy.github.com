    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Listen, islands, to me.<br/>Listen, you peoples, from afar:<br/>the LORD has called me from the womb;<br/>from the inside of my mother, he has mentioned my name.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>He has made my mouth like a sharp sword.<br/>He has hidden me in the shadow of his hand.<br/>He has made me a polished shaft.<br/>He has kept me close in his quiver.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>He said to me, “You are my servant,<br/>Israel, in whom I will be glorified.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>But I said, “I have labored in vain.<br/>I have spent my strength in vain for nothing;<br/>yet surely the justice due to me is with the LORD,<br/>and my reward with my God.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Now the LORD, he who formed me from the womb to be his servant,<br/>says to bring Jacob again to him,<br/>and to gather Israel to him,<br/>for I am honorable in the LORD’s eyes,<br/>and my God has become my strength.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Indeed, he says, “It is too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob,<br/>and to restore the preserved of Israel.<br/>I will also give you as a light to the nations,<br/>that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>The LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One,<br/>says to him whom man despises, to him whom the nation abhors, to a servant of rulers:<br/>“Kings shall see and rise up,<br/>princes, and they shall worship,<br/>because of the LORD who is faithful, even the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>The LORD says, “I have answered you in an acceptable time.<br/>I have helped you in a day of salvation.<br/>I will preserve you and give you for a covenant of the people,<br/>to raise up the land, to make them inherit the desolate heritage,<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>saying to those who are bound, ‘Come out!’;<br/>to those who are in darkness, ‘Show yourselves!’<br/>“They shall feed along the paths,<br/>and their pasture shall be on all treeless heights.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>They shall not hunger nor thirst;<br/>neither shall the heat nor sun strike them,<br/>for he who has mercy on them will lead them.<br/>He will guide them by springs of water.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>I will make all my mountains a road,<br/>and my highways shall be exalted.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Behold, these shall come from afar,<br/>and behold, these from the north and from the west,<br/>and these from the land of Sinim.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Sing, heavens, and be joyful, earth!<br/>Break out into singing, mountains!<br/>For the LORD has comforted his people,<br/>and will have compassion on his afflicted.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>But Zion said, “The LORD has forsaken me,<br/>and the Lord has forgotten me.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>“Can a woman forget her nursing child,<br/>that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb?<br/>Yes, these may forget,<br/>yet I will not forget you!<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands.<br/>Your walls are continually before me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Your children hurry.<br/>Your destroyers and those who devastated you will leave you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Lift up your eyes all around, and see:<br/>all these gather themselves together, and come to you.<br/>As I live,” says the LORD, “you shall surely clothe yourself with them all as with an ornament,<br/>and dress yourself with them, like a bride.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>“For, as for your waste and your desolate places,<br/>and your land that has been destroyed,<br/>surely now that land will be too small for the inhabitants,<br/>and those who swallowed you up will be far away.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>The children of your bereavement will say in your ears,<br/>‘This place is too small for me.<br/>Give me a place to live in.’<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Then you will say in your heart, ‘Who has conceived these for me, since I have been bereaved of my children<br/>and am alone, an exile, and wandering back and forth?<br/>Who has brought these up?<br/>Behold, I was left alone. Where were these?’ ”<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>The Lord GOD says, “Behold, I will lift up my hand to the nations,<br/>and lift up my banner to the peoples.<br/>They shall bring your sons in their bosom,<br/>and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Kings shall be your foster fathers,<br/>and their queens your nursing mothers.<br/>They will bow down to you with their faces to the earth,<br/>and lick the dust of your feet.<br/>Then you will know that I am the LORD;<br/>and those who wait for me won’t be disappointed.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Shall the plunder be taken from the mighty,<br/>or the lawful captives be delivered?<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>But the LORD says, “Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away,<br/>and the plunder retrieved from the fierce,<br/>for I will contend with him who contends with you<br/>and I will save your children.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>I will feed those who oppress you with their own flesh;<br/>and they will be drunk on their own blood, as with sweet wine.<br/>Then all flesh shall know that I, the LORD, am your Savior<br/>and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.”</p></blockquote></section>
