    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel:</p><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>to know wisdom and instruction;<br/>to discern the words of understanding;<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>to receive instruction in wise dealing,<br/>in righteousness, justice, and equity;<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>to give prudence to the simple,<br/>knowledge and discretion to the young man—<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>that the wise man may hear, and increase in learning;<br/>that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel;<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>to understand a proverb and parables,<br/>the words and riddles of the wise.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>The fear of the LORD<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="pro-1-7-note-1">

<span class="sidenote">
            When rendered in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS, “LORD” or “GOD” is the translation of God’s Proper Name (Hebrew “יהוה”, usually pronounced Yahweh).

            “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.
            </span> I will pour out my spirit on you.<br/>I will make known my words to you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Because I have called, and you have refused;<br/>I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid attention;<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>but you have ignored all my counsel,<br/>and wanted none of my reproof;<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>I also will laugh at your disaster.<br/>I will mock when calamity overtakes you,<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>when calamity overtakes you like a storm,<br/>when your disaster comes on like a whirlwind,<br/>when distress and anguish come on you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>Then they will call on me, but I will not answer.<br/>They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me,<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>because they hated knowledge,<br/>and didn’t choose the fear of the LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>They wanted none of my counsel.<br/>They despised all my reproof.<br/><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way,<br/>and be filled with their own schemes.<br/><span class="verse" id="V32"></span>For the backsliding of the simple will kill them.<br/>The careless ease of fools will destroy them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V33"></span>But whoever listens to me will dwell securely,<br/>and will be at ease, without fear of harm.”</p></blockquote></section>
