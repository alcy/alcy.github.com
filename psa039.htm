    <h1>Psalm 39</h1>

    <p class="psalm-subtitle">For the Chief Musician. For Jeduthun. A Psalm by David.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>I said, “I will watch my ways, so that I don’t sin with my tongue.<br/>I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>I was mute with silence.<br/>I held my peace, even from good.<br/>My sorrow was stirred.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>My heart was hot within me.<br/>While I meditated, the fire burned.<br/>I spoke with my tongue:<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>“LORD, show me my end,<br/>what is the measure of my days.<br/>Let me know how frail I am.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Behold, you have made my days hand widths.<br/>My lifetime is as nothing before you.<br/>Surely every man stands as a breath.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>“Surely every man walks like a shadow.<br/>Surely they busy themselves in vain.<br/>He heaps up, and doesn’t know who shall gather.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Now, Lord, what do I wait for?<br/>My hope is in you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Deliver me from all my transgressions.<br/>Don’t make me the reproach of the foolish.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>I was mute.<br/>I didn’t open my mouth,<br/>because you did it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Remove your scourge away from me.<br/>I am overcome by the blow of your hand.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>When you rebuke and correct man for iniquity,<br/>you consume his wealth like a moth.<br/>Surely every man is but a breath.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>“Hear my prayer, LORD, and give ear to my cry.<br/>Don’t be silent at my tears.<br/>For I am a stranger with you,<br/>a foreigner, as all my fathers were.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Oh spare me, that I may recover strength,<br/>before I go away and exist no more.”</p></blockquote></section>
