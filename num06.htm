On the seventh day he shall shave it.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>On the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest, to the door of the Tent of Meeting.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>The priest shall offer one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make atonement for him, because he sinned by reason of the dead, and shall make his head holy that same day.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>He shall separate to the LORD the days of his separation, and shall bring a male lamb a year old for a trespass offering; but the former days shall be void, because his separation was defiled.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>“ ‘This is the law of the Nazirite: when the days of his separation are fulfilled, he shall be brought to the door of the Tent of Meeting,   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>and he shall offer his offering to the LORD: one male lamb a year old without defect for a burnt offering, one ewe lamb a year old without defect for a sin offering, one ram without defect for peace offerings,   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil with their meal offering and their drink offerings.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>The priest shall present them before the LORD, and shall offer his sin offering and his burnt offering.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>He shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread.
