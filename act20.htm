    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>After the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, took leave of them, and departed to go into Macedonia.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>When he had gone through those parts and had encouraged them with many words, he came into Greece.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>When he had spent three months there, and a plot was made against him by Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he determined to return through Macedonia.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>These accompanied him as far as Asia: Sopater of Beroea, Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians, Gaius of Derbe, Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>But these had gone ahead, and were waiting for us at Troas.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>We sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and came to them at Troas in five days, where we stayed seven days.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>On the first day of the week, when the disciples were gathered together to break bread, Paul talked with them, intending to depart on the next day; and continued his speech until midnight.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>There were many lights in the upper room where we<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="act-20-8-note-1">

As Paul spoke still longer, being weighed down by his sleep, he fell down from the third floor and was taken up dead.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Paul went down and fell upon him, and embracing him said, “Don’t be troubled, for his life is in him.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>When he had gone up, had broken bread and eaten, and had talked with them a long while, even until break of day, he departed.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>They brought the boy in alive, and were greatly comforted.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>But we, going ahead to the ship, set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there; for he had so arranged, intending himself to go by land.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>When he met us at Assos, we took him aboard and came to Mitylene.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Sailing from there, we came the following day opposite Chios. The next day we touched at Samos and stayed at Trogyllium, and the day after we came to Miletus.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening, if it were possible for him, to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called to himself the elders of the assembly.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>When they had come to him, he said to them, “You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you all the time,   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>serving the Lord with all humility, with many tears, and with trials which happened to me by the plots of the Jews;   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>how I didn’t shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, teaching you publicly and from house to house,   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="act-20-21-note-1">
