    <h1>Paul's Letter to Titus</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared,   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>not by works of righteousness which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior;   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>that being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you insist confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men;   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning,   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>knowing that such a one is perverted and sinful, being self-condemned.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Let our people also learn to maintain good works to meet necessary needs, that they may not be unfruitful.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith.</p><p>Grace be with you all. Amen.</p></section>
