    <h1>The Letter from James</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Let not many of you be teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive heavier judgment.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>For we all stumble in many things. Anyone who doesn’t stumble in word is a perfect person, able to bridle the whole body also.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Indeed, we put bits into the horses’ mouths so that they may obey us, and we guide their whole body.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Behold,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="jas-3-4-note-1">

<span class="sidenote">
        “Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.
        </span> the ships also, though they are so big and are driven by fierce winds, are yet guided by a very small rudder, wherever the pilot desires.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>So the tongue is also a little member, and boasts great things. See how a small fire can spread to a large forest!   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>And the tongue is a fire. The world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire by Gehenna.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="jas-3-6-note-1">

        or, Hell
        </span> <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>For every kind of animal, bird, creeping thing, and sea creature is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind;   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>but nobody can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men who are made in the image of God.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Out of the same mouth comes blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Does a spring send out from the same opening fresh and bitter water?   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Can a fig tree, my brothers, yield olives, or a vine figs? Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh water.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by his good conduct that his deeds are done in gentleness of wisdom.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, don’t boast and don’t lie against the truth.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, sensual, and demonic.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>For where jealousy and selfish ambition are, there is confusion and every evil deed.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="jas04.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
