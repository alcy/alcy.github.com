    <h1>Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Now concerning spiritual things, brothers, I don’t want you to be ignorant.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>You know that when you were heathen,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="1co-12-2-note-1">

<input class="margin-toggle" id="1co-12-2-note-1" type="checkbox"/>
<span class="sidenote">
        or Gentiles
        </span> you were led away to those mute idols, however you might be led.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by God’s Spirit says, “Jesus is accursed.” No one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” but by the Holy Spirit.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Now there are various kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>There are various kinds of service, and the same Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>There are various kinds of workings, but the same God who works all things in all.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the profit of all.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit,   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit,   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>and to another workings of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another discerning of spirits, to another different kinds of languages, and to another the interpretation of languages.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>But the one and the same Spirit produces all of these, distributing to each one separately as he desires.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>For as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all given to drink into one Spirit.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>For the body is not one member, but many.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>If the foot would say, “Because I’m not the hand, I’m not part of the body,” it is not therefore not part of the body.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>If the ear would say, “Because I’m not the eye, I’m not part of the body,” it’s not therefore not part of the body.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be?   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body, just as he desired.   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>If they were all one member, where would the body be?   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>But now they are many members, but one body.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>The eye can’t tell the hand, “I have no need for you,” or again the head to the feet, “I have no need for you.”   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, on those we bestow more abundant honor; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant modesty,   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>while our presentable parts have no such need. But God composed the body together, giving more abundant honor to the inferior part,   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another.   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>When one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. When one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.   <span class="verse" id="V28"></span>God has set some in the assembly: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracle workers, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, and various kinds of languages.   <span class="verse" id="V29"></span>Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all miracle workers?   <span class="verse" id="V30"></span>Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with various languages? Do all interpret?   <span class="verse" id="V31"></span>But earnestly desire the best gifts. Moreover, I show a most excellent way to you. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="1co13.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
