They camped there before they crossed over.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>After three days, the officers went through the middle of the camp;   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>and they commanded the people, saying, “When you see the ark of the LORD your God’s covenant, and the Levitical priests bearing it, then leave your place and follow it.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Yet there shall be a space between you and it of about two thousand cubits<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="jos-3-4-note-1">
