Therefore it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law,   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was warned by God when he was about to make the tabernacle, for he said, “See, you shall make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="heb-8-5-note-1">
