    <h1>Paul's Letter to the Romans</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Therefore I urge you, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Don’t be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what is the good, well-pleasing, and perfect will of God.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For I say through the grace that was given me, to everyone who is among you, not to think of yourself more highly than you ought to think; but to think reasonably, as God has apportioned to each person a measure of faith.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members don’t have the same function,   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another,   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us: if prophecy, let’s prophesy according to the proportion of our faith;   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>or service, let’s give ourselves to service; or he who teaches, to his teaching;   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>or he who exhorts, to his exhorting; he who gives, let him do it with generosity; he who rules, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil. Cling to that which is good.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>In love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate to one another; in honor prefer one another,   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>not lagging in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord,   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>rejoicing in hope, enduring in troubles, continuing steadfastly in prayer,   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>contributing to the needs of the saints, and given to hospitality.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Bless those who persecute you; bless, and don’t curse.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Rejoice with those who rejoice. Weep with those who weep.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Be of the same mind one toward another. Don’t set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Don’t be wise in your own conceits.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Repay no one evil for evil. Respect what is honorable in the sight of all men.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>If it is possible, as much as it is up to you, be at peace with all men.   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Don’t seek revenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to God’s wrath. For it is written, “Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay, says the Lord.” <label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="rom-12-19-note-1">
