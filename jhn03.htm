        The phrase “only born” is from the Greek word “μονογενη”, which is sometimes translated “only begotten” or “one and only”.
        </span> <span class="wj">Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life. </span> <span class="verse" id="V17"></span><span class="wj">For God didn’t send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through him. </span> <span class="verse" id="V18"></span><span class="wj">He who believes in him is not judged. He who doesn’t believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only born Son of God. </span> <span class="verse" id="V19"></span><span class="wj">This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light, for their works were evil. </span> <span class="verse" id="V20"></span><span class="wj">For everyone who does evil hates the light and doesn’t come to the light, lest his works would be exposed. </span> <span class="verse" id="V21"></span><span class="wj">But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they have been done in God.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>After these things, Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Judea. He stayed there with them and baptized.   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>John also was baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there was much water there. They came and were baptized;   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>for John was not yet thrown into prison.   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>Therefore a dispute arose on the part of John’s disciples with some Jews about purification.   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>They came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, he baptizes, and everyone is coming to him.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>John answered, “A man can receive nothing unless it has been given him from heaven.   <span class="verse" id="V28"></span>You yourselves testify that I said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ but, ‘I have been sent before him.’   <span class="verse" id="V29"></span>He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice. Therefore my joy is made full.   <span class="verse" id="V30"></span>He must increase, but I must decrease.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>“He who comes from above is above all. He who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.   <span class="verse" id="V32"></span>What he has seen and heard, of that he testifies; and no one receives his witness.   <span class="verse" id="V33"></span>He who has received his witness has set his seal to this, that God is true.   <span class="verse" id="V34"></span>For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for God gives the Spirit without measure.   <span class="verse" id="V35"></span>The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.   <span class="verse" id="V36"></span>One who believes in the Son has eternal life, but one who disobeys<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="jhn-3-36-note-1">

        The same word can be translated “disobeys” or “disbelieves” in this context.
