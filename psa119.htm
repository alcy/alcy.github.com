class="verse" id="V4"></span>You have commanded your precepts,<br/>that we should fully obey them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Oh that my ways were steadfast<br/>to obey your statutes!<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Then I wouldn’t be disappointed,<br/>when I consider all of your commandments.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>I will give thanks to you with

me.</p></blockquote><h3>BETH</h3><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>How can a young man keep his way pure?<br/>By living according to your word.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>With my whole heart I have sought you.<br/>Don’t let me wander from your commandments.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>I have hidden your word in my heart,<br/>that I might not sin against you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Blessed are you, LORD.<br/>Teach me your statutes.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>With my lips,<br/>I have declared all the ordinances of your mouth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>I have rejoiced in the way of your testimonies,<br/>as much as in all riches.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>I will meditate on your precepts,<br/>and consider your ways.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>I will delight myself in your statutes.<br/>I will not forget your word.</p></blockquote><h3>GIMEL</h3><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Do good to your servant.<br/>I will live and I will obey your word.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Open my eyes,<br/>that I may see wondrous things out of your law.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>I am a stranger on the earth.<br/>Don’t hide your commandments from me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>My soul is consumed with longing for your ordinances at all times.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>You have rebuked the proud who are cursed,<br/>who wander from your commandments.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Take reproach and contempt away from me,<br/>for I have kept your statutes.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Though princes sit and slander me,<br/>your servant will meditate on your statutes.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Indeed your statutes are my delight,<br/>and my counselors.</p></blockquote><h3>DALETH</h3><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>My soul is laid low in the dust.<br/>Revive me according to your word!<br/><span class="verse"

who fear you,<br/>of those who observe your precepts.<br/><span class="verse" id="V64"></span>The earth is full of your loving kindness, LORD.<br/>Teach me your statutes.</p></blockquote><h3>TETH</h3><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V65"></span>You have treated your servant well,<br/>according to your word, LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V66"></span>Teach me good judgment and knowledge,<br/>for I believe in your commandments.<br/><span class="verse" id="V67"></span>Before I was afflicted, I went astray;<br/>but now I observe your word.<br/><span class="verse" id="V68"></span>You are good, and do good.<br/>Teach me your statutes.<br/><span class="verse" id="V69"></span>The proud have smeared a lie upon me.<br/>With my whole heart, I will keep your precepts.<br/><span class="verse" id="V70"></span>Their heart is as callous as the fat,<br/>but I delight in your law.<br/><span class="verse" id="V71"></span>It is good for me that I have been afflicted,<br/>that I may learn your statutes.<br/><span class="verse" id="V72"></span>The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of pieces of gold and
