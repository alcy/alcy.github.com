    <h1>Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>When I came to you, brothers, I didn’t come with excellence of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>that your faith wouldn’t stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>We speak wisdom, however, among those who are full grown, yet a wisdom not of this world nor of the rulers of this world who are coming to nothing.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>But we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom that has been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds for our glory,   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>which none of the rulers of this world has known. For had they known it, they wouldn’t have crucified the Lord of glory.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>But as it is written,</p><blockquote><p>“Things which an eye didn’t see, and an ear didn’t hear,<br/>which didn’t enter into the heart of man,<br/>these God has prepared for those who love him.”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="1co-2-9-note-1">

<a href="isa64.htm#v4">Isaiah 64:4</a>
</span></p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>But to us, God revealed them through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>For who among men knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so, no one knows the things of God except God’s Spirit.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>But we received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>We also speak these things, not in words which man’s wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Now the natural man doesn’t receive the things of God’s Spirit, for they are foolishness to him; and he can’t know them, because they are spiritually discerned.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>But he who is spiritual discerns all things, and he himself is to be judged by no one.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>“For who has known the mind of the Lord that he should instruct him?”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="1co-2-16-note-1">
