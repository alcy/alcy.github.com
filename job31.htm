    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>“I made a covenant with my eyes;<br/>how then should I look lustfully at a young woman?<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>For what is the portion from God above,<br/>and the heritage from the Almighty on high?<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Is it not calamity to the unrighteous,<br/>and disaster to the workers of iniquity?<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Doesn’t he see my ways,<br/>and count all my steps?<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>“If I have walked with falsehood,<br/>and my foot has hurried to deceit<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>(let me be weighed in an even balance,<br/>that God may know my integrity);<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>if my step has turned out of the way,<br/>if my heart walked after my eyes,<br/>if any defilement has stuck to my hands,<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>then let me sow, and let another eat.<br/>Yes, let the produce of my field be rooted out.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>“If my heart has been enticed to a woman,<br/>and I have laid wait at my neighbor’s door,<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>then let my wife grind for another,<br/>and let others sleep with her.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>For that would be a heinous crime.<br/>Yes, it would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges,<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>for it is a fire that consumes to destruction,<br/>and would root out all my increase.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>“If I have despised the cause of my male servant<br/>or of my female servant,<br/>when they contended with me,<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>what then will I do when God rises up?<br/>When he visits, what will I answer him?<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Didn’t he who made me in the womb make him?<br/>Didn’t one fashion us in the womb?<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>“If I have withheld the poor from their desire,<br/>or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>or have eaten my morsel alone,<br/>and the fatherless has not eaten of it<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>(no, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father,<br/>I have guided her from my mother’s womb);<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>if I have seen any perish for want of clothing,<br/>or that the needy had no covering;<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>if his heart hasn’t blessed me,<br/>if he hasn’t been warmed with my sheep’s fleece;<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless,<br/>because I saw my help in the gate;<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder blade,<br/>and my arm be broken from the bone.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>For calamity from God is a terror to me.<br/>Because of his majesty, I can do nothing.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>“If I have made gold my hope,<br/>and have said to the fine gold, ‘You are my confidence;’<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great,<br/>and because my hand had gotten much;<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>if I have seen the sun when it shined,<br/>or the moon moving in splendor,<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>and my heart has been secretly enticed,<br/>and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth;<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges,<br/>for I would have denied the God who is above.<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>“If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me,<br/>or lifted up myself when evil found him<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>(I have certainly not allowed my mouth to sin<br/>by asking his life with a curse);<br/><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>if the men of my tent have not said,<br/>‘Who can find one who has not been filled with his meat?’<br/><span class="verse" id="V32"></span>(the foreigner has not camped in the street,<br/>but I have opened my doors to the traveler);<br/><span class="verse" id="V33"></span>if like Adam I have covered my transgressions,<br/>by hiding my iniquity in my heart,<br/><span class="verse" id="V34"></span>because I feared the great multitude,<br/>and the contempt of families terrified me,<br/>so that I kept silence, and didn’t go out of the door—<br/><span class="verse" id="V35"></span>oh that I had one to hear me!<br/>Behold, here is my signature! Let the Almighty answer me!<br/>Let the accuser write my indictment!<br/><span class="verse" id="V36"></span>Surely I would carry it on my shoulder,<br/>and I would bind it to me as a crown.<br/><span class="verse" id="V37"></span>I would declare to him the number of my steps.<br/>I would go near to him like a prince.<br/><span class="verse" id="V38"></span>If my land cries out against me,<br/>and its furrows weep together;<br/><span class="verse" id="V39"></span>if I have eaten its fruits without money,<br/>or have caused its owners to lose their life,<br/><span class="verse" id="V40"></span>let briers grow instead of wheat,<br/>and stinkweed instead of barley.”</p></blockquote><p>The words of Job are ended.</p></section>
