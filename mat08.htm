Be made clean.”</span> Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“See that you tell nobody; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>When he came into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking him for help,   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>saying, “Lord, my servant lies in the house paralyzed, grievously tormented.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“I will come and heal him.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>The centurion answered, “Lord, I’m not worthy for you to come under my roof.

I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and tell another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and tell my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>When Jesus heard it, he marveled and said to those who followed, <span class="wj">“Most certainly I tell you, I haven’t found so great a faith, not even in Israel. </span> <span class="verse" id="V11"></span><span class="wj">I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven, </span> <span class="verse" id="V12"></span><span class="wj">but the children of the Kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”</span> <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Jesus said to the centurion, <span class="wj">“Go your way. Let it be done for you as you have believed.”</span> His servant was healed in that hour.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>When Jesus came into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother lying sick with a fever.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>He touched her hand, and the fever left her.
