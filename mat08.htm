There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”</span> <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Jesus said to the centurion, <span class="wj">“Go your way. Let it be done for you as you have believed.”</span> His servant was healed in that hour.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>When Jesus came into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother lying sick with a fever.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>He touched her hand, and the fever left her.
