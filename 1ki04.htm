Each man had to make provision for a month in the year.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>These are their names: Ben Hur, in the hill country of Ephraim;   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Ben Deker, in Makaz, in Shaalbim, Beth Shemesh, and Elon Beth Hanan;   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Ben Hesed, in Arubboth (Socoh and all the land of Hepher belonged to him);   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Ben Abinadab, in all the height of Dor (he had Taphath, Solomon’s daughter, as wife);   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth Shean which is beside Zarethan, beneath Jezreel, from Beth Shean to Abel Meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam;   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Ben Geber, in Ramoth Gilead (the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead, belonged to him; and the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars, belonged to him);   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon as wife);   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth;   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar;   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin;   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer who was in the land.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Judah and Israel were numerous as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt. They brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life.   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty cors<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="1ki-4-22-note-1">

They let nothing be lacking.   <span class="verse" id="V28"></span>They also brought barley and straw for the horses and swift steeds to the place where the officers were, each man according to his duty.   <span class="verse" id="V29"></span>God gave Solomon abundant wisdom, understanding, and breadth of mind like the sand that is on the seashore.   <span class="verse" id="V30"></span>Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V31"></span>For he was wiser than all men—wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol; and his fame was in all the nations all around.   <span class="verse" id="V32"></span>He spoke three thousand proverbs, and his songs numbered one thousand five.   <span class="verse" id="V33"></span>He spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that grows out of the wall; he also spoke of animals, of birds, of creeping things, and of fish.   <span class="verse" id="V34"></span>People of all nations came to hear the wisdom of Solomon, sent by all kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom.</p></section>
