Therefore the LORD your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>“Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God commanded you, that your days may be long and that it may go well with you in the land which the LORD your God gives you.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>“You shall not murder.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>“You shall not commit adultery.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>“You shall not steal.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>“You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>“You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife.

He added no more. He wrote them on two stone tablets, and gave them to me.   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>When you heard the voice out of the middle of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, you came near to me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>and you said, “Behold, the LORD our God has shown us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the middle of the fire. We have seen today that God does speak with man, and he lives.   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>Now therefore, why should we die? For this great fire will consume us. If we hear the LORD our God’s voice any more, then we shall die.   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>For who is there of all flesh who has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the middle of the fire, as we have, and lived?   <span class="verse" id="V27"></span>Go near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say, and tell us all that the LORD our God tells you; and we will hear it, and do it.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>The LORD heard the voice of your words when you spoke to me; and the LORD said to me, “I have heard the voice of the words of this people which they have spoken to you. They have well said all that they have spoken.   <span class="verse" id="V29"></span>Oh that there were such a heart in them that they would fear me and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them and with their children forever!</p><p><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>“Go tell them, ‘Return to your tents.’   <span class="verse" id="V31"></span>But as for you, stand here by me, and I will tell you all the commandments, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which you shall teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V32"></span>You shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God has commanded you. You shall not turn away to the right hand or to the left.   <span class="verse" id="V33"></span>You shall walk in all the way which the LORD your God has commanded you, that you may live and that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess.</p></section>
