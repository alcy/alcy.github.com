    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Every wise woman builds her house,<br/>but the foolish one tears it down with her own hands.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>He who walks in his uprightness fears the LORD,<br/>but he who is perverse in his ways despises him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>The fool’s talk brings a rod to his back,<br/>but the lips of the wise protect them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Where no oxen are, the crib is clean,<br/>but much increase is by the strength of the ox.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>A truthful witness will not lie,<br/>but a false witness pours out lies.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>A scoffer seeks wisdom, and doesn’t find it,<br/>but knowledge comes easily to a discerning person.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Stay away from a foolish man,<br/>for you won’t find knowledge on his lips.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>The wisdom of the prudent is to think about his way,<br/>but the folly of fools is deceit.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Fools mock at making atonement for sins,<br/>but among the upright there is good will.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>The heart knows its own bitterness and joy;<br/>he will not share these with a stranger.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>The house of the wicked will be overthrown,<br/>but the tent of the upright will flourish.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>There is a way which seems right to a man,<br/>but in the end it leads to death.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Even in laughter the heart may be sorrowful,<br/>and mirth may end in heaviness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>The unfaithful will be repaid for his own ways;<br/>likewise a good man will be rewarded for his ways.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>A simple man believes everything,<br/>but the prudent man carefully considers his ways.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>A wise man fears and shuns evil,<br/>but the fool is hot headed and reckless.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>He who is quick to become angry will commit folly,<br/>and a crafty man is hated.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>The simple inherit folly,<br/>but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>The evil bow down before the good,<br/>and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>The poor person is shunned even by his own neighbor,<br/>but the rich person has many friends.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>He who despises his neighbor sins,<br/>but he who has pity on the poor is blessed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Don’t they go astray who plot evil?<br/>But love and faithfulness belong to those who plan good.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>In all hard work there is profit,<br/>but the talk of the lips leads only to poverty.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>The crown of the wise is their riches,<br/>but the folly of fools crowns them with folly.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>A truthful witness saves souls,<br/>but a false witness is deceitful.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>In the fear of the LORD is a secure fortress,<br/>and he will be a refuge for his children.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life,<br/>turning people from the snares of death.<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>In the multitude of people is the king’s glory,<br/>but in the lack of people is the destruction of the prince.<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>He who is slow to anger has great understanding,<br/>but he who has a quick temper displays folly.<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>The life of the body is a heart at peace,<br/>but envy rots the bones.<br/><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>He who oppresses the poor shows contempt for his Maker,<br/>but he who is kind to the needy honors him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V32"></span>The wicked is brought down in his calamity,<br/>but in death, the righteous has a refuge.<br/><span class="verse" id="V33"></span>Wisdom rests in the heart of one who has understanding,<br/>and is even made known in the inward part of fools.<br/><span class="verse" id="V34"></span>Righteousness exalts a nation,<br/>but sin is a disgrace to any people.<br/><span class="verse" id="V35"></span>The king’s favor is toward a servant who deals wisely,<br/>but his wrath is toward one who causes shame. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="pro15.htm">→</a></span></p></blockquote></section>
