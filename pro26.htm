    <h1>The Proverbs</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 26</h2>
    
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Like snow in summer, and as rain in harvest,<br/>so honor is not fitting for a fool.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Like a fluttering sparrow,<br/>like a darting swallow,<br/>so the undeserved curse doesn’t come to rest.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>A whip is for the horse,<br/>a bridle for the donkey,<br/>and a rod for the back of fools!<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Don’t answer a fool according to his folly,<br/>lest you also be like him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Answer a fool according to his folly,<br/>lest he be wise in his own eyes.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>One who sends a message by the hand of a fool<br/>is cutting off feet and drinking violence.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Like the legs of the lame that hang loose,<br/>so is a parable in the mouth of fools.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>As one who binds a stone in a sling,<br/>so is he who gives honor to a fool.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Like a thorn bush that goes into the hand of a drunkard,<br/>so is a parable in the mouth of fools.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>As an archer who wounds all,<br/>so is he who hires a fool<br/>or he who hires those who pass by.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>As a dog that returns to his vomit,<br/>so is a fool who repeats his folly.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Do you see a man wise in his own eyes?<br/>There is more hope for a fool than for him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>The sluggard says, “There is a lion in the road!<br/>A fierce lion roams the streets!”<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>As the door turns on its hinges,<br/>so does the sluggard on his bed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>The sluggard buries his hand in the dish.<br/>He is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes<br/>than seven men who answer with discretion.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Like one who grabs a dog’s ears<br/>is one who passes by and meddles in a quarrel not his own.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Like a madman who shoots torches, arrows, and death,<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, “Am I not joking?”<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>For lack of wood a fire goes out.<br/>Without gossip, a quarrel dies down.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>As coals are to hot embers,<br/>and wood to fire,<br/>so is a contentious man to kindling strife.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels,<br/>they go down into the innermost parts.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Like silver dross on an earthen vessel<br/>are the lips of a fervent one with an evil heart.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>A malicious man disguises himself with his lips,<br/>but he harbors evil in his heart.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>When his speech is charming, don’t believe him,<br/>for there are seven abominations in his heart.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>His malice may be concealed by deception,<br/>but his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>Whoever digs a pit shall fall into it.<br/>Whoever rolls a stone, it will come back on him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>A lying tongue hates those it hurts;<br/>and a flattering mouth works ruin.</p></blockquote></section>
