    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>God is our refuge and strength,<br/>a very present help in trouble.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Therefore we won’t be afraid, though the earth changes,<br/>though the mountains are shaken into the heart of the seas;<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>though its waters roar and are troubled,<br/>though the mountains tremble with their swelling.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>There is a river, the streams of which make the city of God glad,<br/>the holy place of the tents of the Most High.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>God is within her. She shall not be moved.<br/>God will help her at dawn.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>The nations raged. The kingdoms were moved.<br/>He lifted his voice and the earth melted.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>The LORD of Armies is with us.<br/>The God of Jacob is our refuge.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Come, see the LORD’s works,<br/>what desolations he has made in the earth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>He makes wars cease to the end of the earth.<br/>He breaks the bow, and shatters the spear.<br/>He burns the chariots in the fire.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>“Be still, and know that I am God.<br/>I will be exalted among the nations.<br/>I will be exalted in the earth.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>The LORD of Armies is with us.<br/>The God of Jacob is our refuge.</p></blockquote></section>
