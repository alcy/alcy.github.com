    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Naomi had a relative of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I find favor.”</p><p>She said to her, “Go, my daughter.”   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>She went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, “May the LORD be with you.”</p><p>They answered him, “May the LORD bless you.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Then Boaz said to his servant who was set over the reapers, “Whose young lady is this?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>The servant who was set over the reapers answered, “It is the Moabite lady who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>She said, ‘Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.’ So she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, except that she rested a little in the house.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen, my daughter. Don’t go to glean in another field, and don’t go from here, but stay here close to my maidens.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them. Haven’t I commanded the young men not to touch you? When you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink from that which the young men have drawn.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should take knowledge of me, since I am a foreigner?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Boaz answered her, “I have been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you have left your father, your mother, and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you didn’t know before.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>May the LORD repay your work, and a full reward be given to you from the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Then she said, “Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, because you have comforted me, and because you have spoken kindly to your servant, though I am not as one of your servants.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>At meal time Boaz said to her, “Come here, and eat some bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar.”</p><p>She sat beside the reapers, and they passed her parched grain. She ate, was satisfied, and left some of it.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>When she had risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, “Let her glean even among the sheaves, and don’t reproach her.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it. Let her glean, and don’t rebuke her.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>So she gleaned in the field until evening; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="rut-2-17-note-1">

        1 ephah is about 22 liters or about 2/3 of a bushel
        </span> of barley.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>She took it up, and went into the city. Then her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned; and she brought out and gave to her that which she had left after she had enough.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Her mother-in-law said to her, “Where have you gleaned today? Where have you worked? Blessed be he who noticed you.”</p><p>She told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, “The man’s name with whom I worked today is Boaz.”   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May he be blessed by the LORD, who has not abandoned his kindness to the living and to the dead.” Naomi said to her, “The man is a close relative to us, one of our near kinsmen.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Ruth the Moabitess said, “Yes, he said to me, ‘You shall stay close to my young men until they have finished all my harvest.’ ”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, “It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, and that they not harm you in any other field.”   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>So she stayed close to the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she lived with her mother-in-law. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="rut03.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
