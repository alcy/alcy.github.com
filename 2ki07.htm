    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Elisha said, “Hear the LORD’s word. The LORD says, ‘Tomorrow about this time a seah<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="2ki-7-1-note-1">

        A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35 ounces. In this context, it was probably a silver coin weighing that much.

They said to one another, “Why do we sit here until we die?   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>If we say, ‘We will enter into the city,’ then the famine is in the city, and we will die there. If we sit still here, we also die. Now therefore come, and let’s surrender to the army of the Syrians. If they save us alive, we will live; and if they kill us, we will only die.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>They rose up in the twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians. When they had come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians, behold, no man was there.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>For the Lord<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="2ki-7-6-note-1">

Then they came back, and entered into another tent and carried things from there also, and went and hid them.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Then they said to one another, “We aren’t doing right. Today is a day of good news, and we keep silent. If we wait until the morning light, punishment will overtake us. Now therefore come, let’s go and tell the king’s household.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>So they came and called to the city gatekeepers; and they told them, “We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, not even a man’s voice, but the horses tied, and the donkeys tied, and the tents as they were.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Then the gatekeepers called out and told it to the king’s household within.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>The king arose in the night, and said to his servants, “I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry. Therefore they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, ‘When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive, and get into the city.’ ”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>One of his servants answered, “Please let some people take five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city. Behold, they are like all the multitude of Israel who are left in it. Behold, they are like all the multitude of Israel who are consumed. Let’s send and see.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Therefore they took two chariots with horses; and the king sent them out to the Syrian army, saying, “Go and see.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>They went after them to the Jordan; and behold, all the path was full of garments and equipment which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. The messengers returned and told the king.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>The people went out and plundered the camp of the Syrians.
