    <h1>Psalm 69</h1>

    <p class="psalm-subtitle">For the Chief Musician. To the tune of “Lilies.” By David.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Save me, God,<br/>for the waters have come up to my neck!<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold.<br/>I have come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>I am weary with my crying.<br/>My throat is dry.<br/>My eyes fail looking for my God.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head.<br/>Those who want to cut me off, being my enemies wrongfully, are mighty.<br/>I have to restore what I didn’t take away.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>God, you know my foolishness.<br/>My sins aren’t hidden from you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Don’t let those who wait for you be shamed through me, Lord GOD of Armies.<br/>Don’t let those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me, God of Israel.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Because for your sake, I have borne reproach.<br/>Shame has covered my face.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>I have become a stranger to my brothers,<br/>an alien to my mother’s children.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>For the zeal of your house consumes me.<br/>The reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>When I wept and I fasted,<br/>that was to my reproach.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>When I made sackcloth my clothing,<br/>I became a byword to them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Those who sit in the gate talk about me.<br/>I am the song of the drunkards.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>But as for me, my prayer is to you, LORD, in an acceptable time.<br/>God, in the abundance of your loving kindness, answer me in the truth of your salvation.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Deliver me out of the mire, and don’t let me sink.<br/>Let me be delivered from those who hate me, and out of the deep waters.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Don’t let the flood waters overwhelm me,<br/>neither let the deep swallow me up.<br/>Don’t let the pit shut its mouth on me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Answer me, LORD, for your loving kindness is good.<br/>According to the multitude of your tender mercies, turn to me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Don’t hide your face from your servant,<br/>for I am in distress.<br/>Answer me speedily!<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Draw near to my soul and redeem it.<br/>Ransom me because of my enemies.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor.<br/>My adversaries are all before you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness.<br/>I looked for some to take pity, but there was none;<br/>for comforters, but I found none.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>They also gave me poison for my food.<br/>In my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Let their table before them become a snare.<br/>May it become a retribution and a trap.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Let their eyes be darkened, so that they can’t see.<br/>Let their backs be continually bent.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Pour out your indignation on them.<br/>Let the fierceness of your anger overtake them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>Let their habitation be desolate.<br/>Let no one dwell in their tents.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>For they persecute him whom you have wounded.<br/>They tell of the sorrow of those whom you have hurt.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>Charge them with crime upon crime.<br/>Don’t let them come into your righteousness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>Let them be blotted out of the book of life,<br/>and not be written with the righteous.<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>But I am in pain and distress.<br/>Let your salvation, God, protect me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>I will praise the name of God with a song,<br/>and will magnify him with thanksgiving.<br/><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>It will please the LORD better than an ox,<br/>or a bull that has horns and hoofs.<br/><span class="verse" id="V32"></span>The humble have seen it, and are glad.<br/>You who seek after God, let your heart live.<br/><span class="verse" id="V33"></span>For the LORD hears the needy,<br/>and doesn’t despise his captive people.<br/><span class="verse" id="V34"></span>Let heaven and earth praise him;<br/>the seas, and everything that moves therein!<br/><span class="verse" id="V35"></span>For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah.<br/>They shall settle there, and own it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V36"></span>The children also of his servants shall inherit it.<br/>Those who love his name shall dwell therein. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a
