    <h1>Psalm 7</h1>

    <p class="psalm-subtitle">A meditation by David, which he sang to the LORD, concerning the words of Cush, the Benjamite.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>LORD, my God, I take refuge in you.<br/>Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me,<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>lest they tear apart my soul like a lion,<br/>ripping it in pieces, while there is no one to deliver.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>LORD, my God, if I have done this,<br/>if there is iniquity in my hands,<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me<br/>(yes, I have plundered him who without cause was my adversary),<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it;<br/>yes, let him tread my life down to the earth,<br/>and lay my glory in the dust.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Arise, LORD, in your anger.<br/>Lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries.<br/>Awake for me. You have commanded judgment.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Let the congregation of the peoples surround you.<br/>Rule over them on high.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>The LORD administers judgment to the peoples.<br/>Judge me, LORD, according to my righteousness,<br/>and to my integrity that is in me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end,<br/>but establish the righteous;<br/>their minds and hearts are searched by the righteous God.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>My shield is with God,<br/>who saves the upright in heart.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>God is a righteous judge,<br/>yes, a God who has indignation every day.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>If a man doesn’t repent, he will sharpen his sword;<br/>he has bent and strung his bow.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>He has also prepared for himself the instruments of death.<br/>He makes ready his flaming arrows.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Behold,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="psa-7-14-note-1">
</label>
<input class="margin-toggle" id="psa-7-14-note-1" type="checkbox"/>
<span class="sidenote">
            “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.
            </span> he travails with iniquity.<br/>Yes, he has conceived mischief,<br/>and brought out falsehood.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>He has dug a hole,<br/>and has fallen into the pit which he made.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>The trouble he causes shall return to his own head.<br/>His violence shall come down on the crown of his own head.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>I will give thanks to the LORD according to his righteousness,<br/>and will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.</p></blockquote></section>
