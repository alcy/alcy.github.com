    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>The LORD says:</p><blockquote><p>“Maintain justice<br/>and do what is right,<br/>for my salvation is near<br/>and my righteousness will soon be revealed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Blessed is the man who does this,<br/>and the son of man who holds it fast;<br/>who keeps the Sabbath without profaning it<br/>and keeps his hand from doing any evil.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Let no foreigner who has joined himself to the LORD speak, saying,<br/>“The LORD will surely separate me from his people.”<br/>Do not let the eunuch say, “Behold, I am a dry tree.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>For the LORD says, “To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths,<br/>choose the things that please me,<br/>and hold fast to my covenant,<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>I will give them in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of daughters.<br/>I will give them an everlasting name that will not be cut off.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Also the foreigners who join themselves to the LORD<br/>to serve him,<br/>and to love the LORD’s name,<br/>to be his servants,<br/>everyone who keeps the Sabbath from profaning it,<br/>and holds fast my covenant,<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>I will bring these to my holy mountain,<br/>and make them joyful in my house of prayer.<br/>Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar;<br/>for my house will be called a house of prayer for all peoples.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>The Lord GOD, who gathers the outcasts of Israel, says,<br/>“I will yet gather others to him,<br/>in addition to his own who are gathered.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>All you animals of the field,<br/>come to devour,<br/>all you animals in the forest.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>His watchmen are blind.<br/>They are all without knowledge.<br/>They are all mute dogs.<br/>They can’t bark—<br/>dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Yes, the dogs are greedy.<br/>They can never have enough.<br/>They are shepherds who can’t understand.<br/>They have all turned to their own way,<br/>each one to his gain, from every quarter.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>“Come,” they say, “I will get wine,<br/>and we will fill ourselves with strong drink;<br/>and tomorrow will be as today,<br/>great beyond measure.” <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="isa57.htm">→</a></span></p></blockquote></section>
