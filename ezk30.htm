    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>The LORD’s word came again to me, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>“Son of man, prophesy, and say, ‘The Lord GOD says:</p><blockquote><p>“Wail, ‘Alas for the day!’<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For the day is near,<br/>even the LORD’s day is near.<br/>It will be a day of clouds,<br/>a time of the nations.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>A sword will come on Egypt,<br/>and anguish will be in Ethiopia,<br/>when the slain fall in Egypt.<br/>They take away her multitude,<br/>and her foundations are broken down.</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>“ ‘ “Ethiopia, Put, Lud, all the mixed people, Cub, and the children of the land that is allied with them, will fall with them by the sword.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>“ ‘The LORD says:</p><blockquote><p>“They also who uphold Egypt will fall.<br/>The pride of her power will come down.<br/>They will fall by the sword in it from the tower of Seveneh,”<br/>says the Lord GOD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>“They will be desolate in the middle of the countries that are desolate.<br/>Her cities will be among the cities that are wasted.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>They will know that I am the LORD<br/>when I have set a fire in Egypt,<br/>and all her helpers are destroyed.</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>“ ‘ “In that day messengers will go out from before me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid. There will be anguish on them, as in the day of Egypt; for, behold, it comes.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>“ ‘The Lord GOD says:</p><blockquote><p>“I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease,<br/>by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>He and his people with him,<br/>the terrible of the nations,<br/>will be brought in to destroy the land.<br/>They will draw their swords against Egypt,<br/>and fill the land with the slain.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>I will make the rivers dry,<br/>and will sell the land into the hand of evil men.<br/>I will make the land desolate,<br/>and all that is therein,<br/>by the hand of foreigners.<br/>I, the LORD, have spoken it.”</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>“ ‘The Lord GOD says:</p><blockquote><p>“I will also destroy the idols,<br/>and I will cause the images to cease from Memphis.<br/>There will be no more a prince from the land of Egypt.<br/>I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>I will make Pathros desolate,<br/>and will set a fire in Zoan,<br/>and will execute judgments on No.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>I will pour my wrath on Sin,<br/>the stronghold of Egypt.<br/>I will cut off the multitude of No.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>I will set a fire in Egypt<br/>Sin will be in great anguish.<br/>No will be broken up.<br/>Memphis will have adversaries in the daytime.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth will fall by the sword.<br/>They will go into captivity.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>At Tehaphnehes also the day will withdraw itself,<br/>when I break the yokes of Egypt there.<br/>The pride of her power will cease in her.<br/>As for her, a cloud will cover her,<br/>and her daughters will go into captivity.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Thus I will execute judgments on Egypt.<br/>Then they will know that I am the LORD.” ’ ”</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>In the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, the LORD’s word came to me, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>“Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt. Behold, it has not been bound up, to apply medicines, to put a bandage to bind it, that it may become strong to hold the sword.   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Therefore the Lord GOD says: ‘Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong arm, and that which was broken. I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand; but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he will groan before the king of Babylon with the groaning of a mortally wounded man.   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>I will hold up the arms of the king of Babylon, but the arms of Pharaoh will fall down. Then they will know that I am the LORD when I put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he stretches it out on the land of Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them through the countries. Then they will know that I am the LORD.’ ”</p></section>
