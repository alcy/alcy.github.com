    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>But in the latter days,<br/>it will happen that the mountain of the LORD’s temple will be established on the top of the mountains,<br/>and it will be exalted above the hills;<br/>and peoples will stream to it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Many nations will go and say,<br/>“Come! Let’s go up to the mountain of the LORD,<br/>and to the house of the God of Jacob;<br/>and he will teach us of his ways,<br/>and we will walk in his paths.”<br/>For the law will go out of Zion,<br/>and the LORD’s word from Jerusalem;<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>and he will judge between many peoples,<br/>and will decide concerning strong nations afar off.<br/>They will beat their swords into plowshares,<br/>and their spears into pruning hooks.<br/>Nation will not lift up sword against nation,<br/>neither will they learn war any more.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>But every man will sit under his vine and under his fig tree.<br/>No one will make them afraid,<br/>for the mouth of the LORD of Armies has spoken.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Indeed all the nations may walk in the name of their gods,<br/>but we will walk in the name of the LORD our God forever and ever.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>“In that day,” says the LORD,<br/>“I will assemble that which is lame,<br/>and I will gather that which is driven away,<br/>and that which I have afflicted;<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>and I will make that which was lame a remnant,<br/>and that which was cast far off a strong nation:<br/>and the LORD will reign over them on Mount Zion from then on, even forever.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>You, tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion,<br/>to you it will come.<br/>Yes, the former dominion will come,<br/>the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Now why do you cry out aloud?<br/>Is there no king in you?<br/>Has your counselor perished,<br/>that pains have taken hold of you as of a woman in travail?<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Be in pain, and labor to give birth, daughter of Zion,<br/>like a woman in travail;<br/>for now you will go out of the city,<br/>and will dwell in the field,<br/>and will come even to Babylon.<br/>There you will be rescued.<br/>There the LORD will redeem you from the hand of your enemies.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Now many nations have assembled against you, that say,<br/>“Let her be defiled,<br/>and let our eye gloat over Zion.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>But they don’t know the thoughts of the LORD,<br/>neither do they understand his counsel;<br/>for he has gathered them like the sheaves to the threshing floor.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion,<br/>for I will make your horn iron,<br/>and I will make your hoofs bronze.<br/>You will beat in pieces many peoples.<br/>I will devote their gain to the LORD,<br/>and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="mic05.htm">→</a></span></p></blockquote></section>
