    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>A false balance is an abomination to the LORD,<br/>but accurate weights are his delight.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>When pride comes, then comes shame,<br/>but with humility comes wisdom.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>The integrity of the upright shall guide them,<br/>but the perverseness of the treacherous shall destroy them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Riches don’t profit in the day of wrath,<br/>but righteousness delivers from death.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>The righteousness of the blameless will direct his way,<br/>but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them,<br/>but the unfaithful will be trapped by evil desires.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>When a wicked man dies, hope perishes,<br/>and expectation of power comes to nothing.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>A righteous person is delivered out of trouble,<br/>and the wicked takes his place.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>With his mouth the godless man destroys his neighbor,<br/>but the righteous will be delivered through knowledge.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices.<br/>When the wicked perish, there is shouting.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>By the blessing of the upright, the city is exalted,<br/>but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>One who despises his neighbor is void of wisdom,<br/>but a man of understanding holds his peace.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>One who brings gossip betrays a confidence,<br/>but one who is of a trustworthy spirit is one who keeps a secret.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Where there is no wise guidance, the nation falls,<br/>but in the multitude of counselors there is victory.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>He who is collateral for a stranger will suffer for it,<br/>but he who refuses pledges of collateral is secure.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>A gracious woman obtains honor,<br/>but violent men obtain riches.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>The merciful man does good to his own soul,<br/>but he who is cruel troubles his own flesh.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Wicked people earn deceitful wages,<br/>but one who sows righteousness reaps a sure reward.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>He who is truly righteous gets life.<br/>He who pursues evil gets death.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Those who are perverse in heart are an abomination to the LORD,<br/>but those whose ways are blameless are his delight.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Most certainly, the evil man will not be unpunished,<br/>but the offspring<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="pro-11-21-note-1">

            or, seed
            </span> of the righteous will be delivered.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Like a gold ring in a pig’s snout,<br/>is a beautiful woman who lacks discretion.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>The desire of the righteous is only good.<br/>The expectation of the wicked is wrath.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>There is one who scatters, and increases yet more.<br/>There is one who withholds more than is appropriate, but gains poverty.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>The liberal soul shall be made fat.<br/>He who waters shall be watered also himself.<br/><span class="verse" id="V26"></span>People curse someone who withholds grain,<br/>but blessing will be on the head of him who sells it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>He who diligently seeks good seeks favor,<br/>but he who searches after evil, it shall come to him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>He who trusts in his riches will fall,<br/>but the righteous shall flourish as the green leaf.<br/><span class="verse" id="V29"></span>He who troubles his own house shall inherit the wind.<br/>The foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart.<br/><span class="verse" id="V30"></span>The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life.<br/>He who is wise wins souls.<br/><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>Behold, the righteous shall be repaid in the earth,<br/>how much more the wicked and the sinner!</p></blockquote></section>
