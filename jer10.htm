    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Hear the word which the LORD speaks to you, house of Israel!   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>The LORD says,</p><blockquote><p>“Don’t learn the way of the nations,<br/>and don’t be dismayed at the signs of the sky;<br/>for the nations are dismayed at them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For the customs of the peoples are vanity;<br/>for one cuts a tree out of the forest,<br/>the work of the hands of the workman with the ax.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>They deck it with silver and with gold.<br/>They fasten it with nails and with hammers,<br/>so that it can’t move.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>They are like a palm tree, of turned work,<br/>and don’t speak.<br/>They must be carried,<br/>because they can’t move.<br/>Don’t be afraid of them;<br/>for they can’t do evil,<br/>neither is it in them to do good.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>There is no one like you, LORD.<br/>You are great,<br/>and your name is great in might.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Who shouldn’t fear you,<br/>King of the nations?<br/>For it belongs to you.<br/>Because among all the wise men of the nations,<br/>and in all their royal estate,<br/>there is no one like you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>But they are together brutish and foolish,<br/>instructed by idols!<br/>It is just wood.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish,<br/>and gold from Uphaz,<br/>the work of the engraver and of the hands of the goldsmith.<br/>Their clothing is blue and purple.<br/>They are all the work of skillful men.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>But the LORD is the true God.<br/>He is the living God,<br/>and an everlasting King.<br/>At his wrath, the earth trembles.<br/>The nations aren’t able to withstand his indignation.</p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>“You shall say this to them: ‘The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.’ ”</p><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>God has made the earth by his power.<br/>He has established the world by his wisdom,<br/>and by his understanding has he stretched out the heavens.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>When he utters his voice,<br/>the waters in the heavens roar,<br/>and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth.<br/>He makes lightnings for the rain,<br/>and brings the wind out of his treasuries.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Every man has become brutish and without knowledge.<br/>Every goldsmith is disappointed by his engraved image;<br/>for his molten image is falsehood,<br/>and there is no breath in them.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>They are vanity, a work of delusion.<br/>In the time of their visitation they will perish.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>The portion of Jacob is not like these;<br/>for he is the maker of all things;<br/>and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance.<br/>The LORD of Armies is his name.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Gather up your wares out of the land,<br/>you who live under siege.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>For the LORD says,<br/>“Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time,<br/>and will distress them, that they may feel it.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Woe is me because of my injury!<br/>My wound is serious;<br/>but I said,<br/>“Truly this is my grief, and I must bear it.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>My tent has been destroyed,<br/>and all my cords are broken.<br/>My children have gone away from me, and they are no more.<br/>There is no one to spread my tent any more,<br/>to set up my curtains.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>For the shepherds have become brutish,<br/>and have not inquired of the LORD.<br/>Therefore they have not prospered,<br/>and all their flocks have scattered.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>The voice of news, behold, it comes,<br/>and a great commotion out of the north country,<br/>to make the cities of Judah a desolation,<br/>a dwelling place of jackals.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself.<br/>It is not in man who walks to direct his steps.<br/><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>LORD, correct me, but gently;<br/>not in your anger,<br/>lest you reduce me to nothing.<br/><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you,<br/>and on the families that don’t call on your name;<br/>for they have devoured Jacob.<br/>Yes, they have devoured him, consumed him,<br/>and have laid waste his habitation.</p></blockquote></section>
