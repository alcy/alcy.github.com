    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Remember, LORD, what has come on us.<br/>Look, and see our reproach.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers,<br/>our houses to aliens.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>We are orphans and fatherless.<br/>Our mothers are as widows.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>We must pay for water to drink.<br/>Our wood is sold to us.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Our pursuers are on our necks.<br/>We are weary, and have no rest.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>We have given our hands to the Egyptians,<br/>and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Our fathers sinned, and are no more.<br/>We have borne their iniquities.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Servants rule over us.<br/>There is no one to deliver us out of their hand.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>We get our bread at the peril of our lives,<br/>because of the sword in the wilderness.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Our skin is black like an oven,<br/>because of the burning heat of famine.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>They ravished the women in Zion,<br/>the virgins in the cities of Judah.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Princes were hanged up by their hands.<br/>The faces of elders were not honored.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>The young men carry millstones.<br/>The children stumbled under loads of wood.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>The elders have ceased from the gate,<br/>and the young men from their music.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>The joy of our heart has ceased.<br/>Our dance is turned into mourning.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>The crown has fallen from our head.<br/>Woe to us, for we have sinned!<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>For this our heart is faint.<br/>For these things our eyes are dim:<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>for the mountain of Zion, which is desolate.<br/>The foxes walk on it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>You, LORD, remain forever.<br/>Your throne is from generation to generation.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Why do you forget us forever,<br/>and forsake us for so long a time?<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Turn us to yourself, LORD, and we will be turned.<br/>Renew our days as of old.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>But you have utterly rejected us.<br/>You are very angry against us. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="ezk01.htm">→</a></span></p></blockquote></section>
