    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Wisdom has built her house.<br/>She has carved out her seven pillars.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>She has prepared her meat.<br/>She has mixed her wine.<br/>She has also set her table.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>She has sent out her maidens.<br/>She cries from the highest places of the city:<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>“Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!”<br/>As for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>“Come, eat some of my bread,<br/>Drink some of the wine which I have mixed!<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Leave your simple ways, and live.<br/>Walk in the way of understanding.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>One who corrects a mocker invites insult.<br/>One who reproves a wicked man invites abuse.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Don’t reprove a scoffer, lest he hate you.<br/>Reprove a wise person, and he will love you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Instruct a wise person, and he will be still wiser.<br/>Teach a righteous person, and he will increase in learning.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom.<br/>The knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>For by me your days will be multiplied.<br/>The years of your life will be increased.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>If you are wise, you are wise for yourself.<br/>If you mock, you alone will bear it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>The foolish woman is loud,<br/>undisciplined, and knows nothing.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>She sits at the door of her house,<br/>on a seat in the high places of the city,<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>to call to those who pass by,<br/>who go straight on their ways,<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>“Whoever is simple, let him turn in here.”<br/>As for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>“Stolen water is sweet.<br/>Food eaten in secret is pleasant.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>But he doesn’t know that the departed spirits are there,<br/>that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="pro-9-18-note-1">
