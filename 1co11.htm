    <h1>Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 11</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Be imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and hold firm the traditions, even as I delivered them to you.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>But I would have you know that the head<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="1co-11-3-note-1">

<input class="margin-toggle" id="1co-11-3-note-2" type="checkbox"/>
<span class="sidenote">
        or, origin
        </span> of the woman is man, and the head<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="1co-11-3-note-3">
</label>
<input class="margin-toggle" id="1co-11-3-note-3" type="checkbox"/>
<span class="sidenote">
        or, origin
        </span> of Christ is God.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered dishonors her head. For it is one and the same thing as if she were shaved.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>For if a woman is not covered, let her hair also be cut off. But if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or be shaved, let her be covered.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>For man is not from woman, but woman from man;   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>for man wasn’t created for the woman, but woman for the man.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>For this cause the woman ought to have authority over her own head, because of the angels.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Nevertheless, neither is the woman independent of the man, nor the man independent of the woman, in the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>For as woman came from man, so a man also comes through a woman; but all things are from God.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Judge for yourselves. Is it appropriate that a woman pray to God unveiled?   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Doesn’t even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him?   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, for her hair is given to her for a covering.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>But if any man seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither do God’s assemblies.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>But in giving you this command I don’t praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>For first of all, when you come together in the assembly, I hear that divisions exist among you, and I partly believe it.   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>For there also must be factions among you, that those who are approved may be revealed among you.   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>When therefore you assemble yourselves together, it is not the Lord’s supper that you eat.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>For in your eating each one takes his own supper first. One is hungry, and another is drunken.   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>What, don’t you have houses to eat and to drink in? Or do you despise God’s assembly and put them to shame who don’t have enough? What shall I tell you? Shall I praise you? In this I don’t praise you.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread.   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>When he had given thanks, he broke it and said, <span class="wj">“Take, eat. This is my body, which is broken for you. Do this in memory of me.”</span> <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>In the same way he also took the cup after supper, saying, <span class="wj">“This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink, in memory of me.”</span> <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V27"></span>Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord’s cup in a way unworthy of the Lord will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V28"></span>But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.   <span class="verse" id="V29"></span>For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy way eats and drinks judgment to himself if he doesn’t discern the Lord’s body.   <span class="verse" id="V30"></span>For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.   <span class="verse" id="V31"></span>For if we discerned ourselves, we wouldn’t be judged.   <span class="verse" id="V32"></span>But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.   <span class="verse" id="V33"></span>Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.   <span class="verse" id="V34"></span>But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest your coming together be for judgment. The rest I will set in order whenever I come.</p></section>
