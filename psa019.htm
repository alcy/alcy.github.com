    <h1>Psalm 19</h1>

    <p class="psalm-subtitle">For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>The heavens declare the glory of God.<br/>The expanse shows his handiwork.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Day after day they pour out speech,<br/>and night after night they display knowledge.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>There is no speech nor language<br/>where their voice is not heard.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Their voice has gone out through all the earth,<br/>their words to the end of the world.<br/>In them he has set a tent for the sun,<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>which is as a bridegroom coming out of his room,<br/>like a strong man rejoicing to run his course.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>His going out is from the end of the heavens,<br/>his circuit to its ends.<br/>There is nothing hidden from its heat.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>The LORD’s law is perfect, restoring the soul.<br/>The LORD’s covenant is sure, making wise the simple.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>The LORD’s precepts are right, rejoicing the heart.<br/>The LORD’s commandment is pure, enlightening the eyes.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever.<br/>The LORD’s ordinances are true, and righteous altogether.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>They are more to be desired than gold, yes, than much fine gold,<br/>sweeter also than honey and the extract of the honeycomb.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Moreover your servant is warned by them.<br/>In keeping them there is great reward.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Who can discern his errors?<br/>Forgive me from hidden errors.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins.<br/>Let them not have dominion over me.<br/>Then I will be upright.<br/>I will be blameless and innocent of great transgression.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart<br/>be acceptable in your sight,<br/>LORD, my rock, and my redeemer.</p></blockquote></section>
