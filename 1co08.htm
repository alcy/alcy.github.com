    <h1>Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>But if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he doesn’t yet know as he ought to know.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>But anyone who loves God is known by him.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no other God but one.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>For though there are things that are called “gods”, whether in the heavens or on earth—as there are many “gods” and many “lords”—   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we live through him.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>However, that knowledge isn’t in all men. But some, with consciousness of an idol until now, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>But food will not commend us to God. For neither, if we don’t eat are we the worse, nor if we eat are we the better.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>But be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>For if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol’s temple, won’t his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>And through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake Christ died.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will eat no meat forever more, that I don’t cause my brother to stumble.</p></section>
