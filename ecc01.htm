    <h1>Ecclesiastes</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem:</p><p><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>“Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher; “Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.”   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>What does man gain from all his labor in which he labors under the sun?   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>One generation goes, and another generation comes; but the earth remains forever.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, and hurries to its place where it rises.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>The wind goes toward the south, and turns around to the north. It turns around continually as it goes, and the wind returns again to its courses.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers flow, there they flow again.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>All things are full of weariness beyond uttering. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>That which has been is that which shall be, and that which has been done is that which shall be done; and there is no new thing under the sun.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Is there a thing of which it may be said, “Behold,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="ecc-1-10-note-1">

<input class="margin-toggle" id="ecc-1-10-note-1" type="checkbox"/>
<span class="sidenote">
        “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.
        </span> this is new”? It has been long ago, in the ages which were before us.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>There is no memory of the former; neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to come, among those that shall come after.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the sky. It is a heavy burden that God<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="ecc-1-13-note-1">

<span class="sidenote">
        The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).
        </span> has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and behold, all is vanity and a chasing after wind.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>That which is crooked can’t be made straight; and that which is lacking can’t be counted.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>I said to myself, “Behold, I have obtained for myself great wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem. Yes, my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.”   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also was a chasing after wind.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>For in much wisdom is much grief; and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.</p></section>
