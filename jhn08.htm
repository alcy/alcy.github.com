He sat down and taught them.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman taken in adultery. Having set her in the middle,   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>they told him, “Teacher, we found this woman in adultery, in the very act.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Now in our law, Moses commanded us to stone such women.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="jhn-8-5-note-1">

Jesus was left alone with the woman where she was, in the middle.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Jesus, standing up, saw her and said, <span class="wj">“Woman, where are your accusers?

How do you say, <span class="wj">‘You will be made free’</span>?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V34"></span>Jesus answered them, <span class="wj">“Most certainly I tell you, everyone who commits sin is the bondservant of sin. </span> <span class="verse" id="V35"></span><span class="wj">A bondservant doesn’t live in the house forever.
