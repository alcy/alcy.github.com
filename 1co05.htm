    <h1>Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles, that one has his father’s wife.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>You are arrogant, and didn’t mourn instead, that he who had done this deed might be removed from among you.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For I most certainly, as being absent in body but present in spirit, have already, as though I were present, judged him who has done this thing.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together with my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>you are to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Your boasting is not good. Don’t you know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump?   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Purge out the old yeast, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed in our place.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Therefore let’s keep the feast, not with old yeast, neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners;   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world, or with the covetous and extortionists, or with idolaters, for then you would have to leave the world.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>But as it is, I wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a sexual sinner, or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an extortionist. Don’t even eat with such a person.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>For what do I have to do with also judging those who are outside? Don’t you judge those who are within?   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>But those who are outside, God judges. “Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="1co-5-13-note-1">
