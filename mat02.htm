Opening their treasures, they offered to him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back to their own country another way.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, “Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>He arose and took the young child and his mother by night and departed into Egypt,   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>and was there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, “Out of Egypt I called my son.”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="mat-2-15-note-1">
