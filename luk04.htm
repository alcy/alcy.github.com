The eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>He began to tell them, <span class="wj">“Today, this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>All testified about him and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth; and they said, “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Doubtless you will tell me this proverb, ‘Physician, heal yourself! Whatever we have heard done at Capernaum, do also here in your hometown.’ ”</span> <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>He said, <span class="wj">“Most certainly I tell you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown. </span> <span class="verse" id="V25"></span><span class="wj">But truly I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land. </span> <span class="verse" id="V26"></span><span class="wj">Elijah was sent to none of them, except to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow. </span> <span class="verse" id="V27"></span><span class="wj">There were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed, except Naaman, the Syrian.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V28"></span>They were all filled with wrath in the synagogue as they heard these things.   <span class="verse" id="V29"></span>They rose up, threw him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill that their city was built on, that they might throw him off the cliff.   <span class="verse" id="V30"></span>But he, passing through the middle of them, went his way.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. He was teaching them on the Sabbath day,   <span class="verse" id="V32"></span>and they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority.   <span class="verse" id="V33"></span>In the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon; and he cried out with a loud voice,   <span class="verse" id="V34"></span>saying, “Ah! what have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are: the Holy One of God!”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V35"></span>Jesus rebuked him, saying, <span class="wj">“Be silent and come out of him!” </span> When the demon had thrown him down in the middle of them, he came out of him, having done him no harm.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V36"></span>Amazement came on all and they spoke together, one with another, saying, “What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!”   <span class="verse" id="V37"></span>News about him went out into every place of the surrounding region.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V38"></span>He rose up from the synagogue and entered into Simon’s house. Simon’s mother-in-law was afflicted with a great fever, and they begged him to help her.   <span class="verse" id="V39"></span>He stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. Immediately she rose up and served them.   <span class="verse" id="V40"></span>When the sun was setting, all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.   <span class="verse" id="V41"></span>Demons also came out of many, crying out and saying, “You are the Christ, the Son of God!” Rebuking them, he didn’t allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V42"></span>When it was day, he departed and went into an uninhabited place and the multitudes looked for him, and came to him, and held on to him, so that he wouldn’t go away from them.   <span class="verse" id="V43"></span>But he said to them, <span class="wj">“I must preach the good news of God’s Kingdom to the other cities also. For this reason I have been sent.”</span> <span class="verse" id="V44"></span>He was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.</p></section>
