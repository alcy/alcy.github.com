    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>The Mighty One, God, the LORD, speaks,<br/>and calls the earth from sunrise to sunset.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty,<br/>God shines out.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Our God comes, and does not keep silent.<br/>A fire devours before him.<br/>It is very stormy around him.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>He calls to the heavens above,<br/>to the earth, that he may judge his people:<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>“Gather my saints together to me,<br/>those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>The heavens shall declare his righteousness,<br/>for God himself is judge.<br/><span class="selah">Selah.</span><br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>“Hear, my people, and I will speak.<br/>Israel, I will testify against you.<br/>I am God, your God.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>I don’t rebuke you for your sacrifices.<br/>Your burnt offerings are continually before me.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>I have no need for a bull from your stall,<br/>nor male goats from your pens.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>For every animal of the forest is mine,<br/>and the livestock on a thousand hills.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>I know all the birds of the mountains.<br/>The wild animals of the field are mine.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>If I were hungry, I would not tell you,<br/>for the world is mine, and all that is in it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Will I eat the meat of bulls,<br/>or drink the blood of goats?<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Offer to God the sacrifice of thanksgiving.<br/>Pay your vows to the Most High.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Call on me in the day of trouble.<br/>I will deliver you, and you will honor me.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>But to the wicked God says,<br/>“What right do you have to declare my statutes,<br/>that you have taken my covenant on your lips,<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>since you hate instruction,<br/>and throw my words behind you?<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>When you saw a thief, you consented with him,<br/>and have participated with adulterers.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>“You give your mouth to evil.<br/>Your tongue frames deceit.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>You sit and speak against your brother.<br/>You slander your own mother’s son.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>You have done these things, and I kept silent.<br/>You thought that I was just like you.<br/>I will rebuke you, and accuse you in front of your eyes.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>“Now consider this, you who forget God,<br/>lest I tear you into pieces, and there be no one to deliver.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Whoever offers the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifies me,<br/>and prepares his way so that I will show God’s salvation to him.” <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="psa051.htm">→</a></span></p></blockquote></section>
