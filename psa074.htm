    <h1>Psalm 74</h1>

    <p class="psalm-subtitle">A contemplation by Asaph.</p>
    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>God, why have you rejected us forever?<br/>Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Remember your congregation, which you purchased of old,<br/>which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance:<br/>Mount Zion, in which you have lived.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins,<br/>all the evil that the enemy has done in the sanctuary.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Your adversaries have roared in the middle of your assembly.<br/>They have set up their standards as signs.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>They behaved like men wielding axes,<br/>cutting through a thicket of trees.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Now they break all its carved work down with hatchet and hammers.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>They have burned your sanctuary to the ground.<br/>They have profaned the dwelling place of your Name.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>They said in their heart, “We will crush them completely.”<br/>They have burned up all the places in the land where God was worshiped.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>We see no miraculous signs.<br/>There is no longer any prophet,<br/>neither is there among us anyone who knows how long.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>How long, God, shall the adversary reproach?<br/>Shall the enemy blaspheme your name forever?<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Why do you draw back your hand, even your right hand?<br/>Take it from your chest and consume them!<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Yet God is my King of old,<br/>working salvation throughout the earth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>You divided the sea by your strength.<br/>You broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces.<br/>You gave him as food to people and desert creatures.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>You opened up spring and stream.<br/>You dried up mighty rivers.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>The day is yours, the night is also yours.<br/>You have prepared the light and the sun.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>You have set all the boundaries of the earth.<br/>You have made summer and winter.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Remember this, that the enemy has mocked you, LORD.<br/>Foolish people have blasphemed your name.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Don’t deliver the soul of your dove to wild beasts.<br/>Don’t forget the life of your poor forever.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Honor your covenant,<br/>for haunts of violence fill the dark places of the earth.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Don’t let the oppressed return ashamed.<br/>Let the poor and needy praise your name.<br/><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Arise, God! Plead your own cause.<br/>Remember how the foolish man mocks you all day.<br/><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>Don’t forget the voice of your adversaries.<br/>The tumult of those who rise up against you ascends continually.</p></blockquote></section>
