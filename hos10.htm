    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Israel is a luxuriant vine that produces his fruit.</p><blockquote><p>According to the abundance of his fruit he has multiplied his altars.<br/>As their land has prospered, they have adorned their sacred stones.<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Their heart is divided.<br/>Now they will be found guilty.<br/>He will demolish their altars.<br/>He will destroy their sacred stones.<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Surely now they will say, “We have no king; for we don’t fear the LORD;<br/>and the king, what can he do for us?”<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>They make promises, swearing falsely in making covenants.<br/>Therefore judgment springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>The inhabitants of Samaria will be in terror for the calves of Beth Aven,<br/>for its people will mourn over it,<br/>along with its priests who rejoiced over it,<br/>for its glory, because it has departed from it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>It also will be carried to Assyria for a present to a great king.<br/>Ephraim will receive shame,<br/>and Israel will be ashamed of his own counsel.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Samaria and her king float away<br/>like a twig on the water.<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed.<br/>The thorn and the thistle will come up on their altars.<br/>They will tell the mountains, “Cover us!” and the hills, “Fall on us!”<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>“Israel, you have sinned from the days of Gibeah.<br/>There they remained.<br/>The battle against the children of iniquity doesn’t overtake them in Gibeah.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>When it is my desire, I will chastise them;<br/>and the nations will be gathered against them<br/>when they are bound to their two transgressions.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh,<br/>so I will put a yoke on her beautiful neck.<br/>I will set a rider on Ephraim.<br/>Judah will plow.<br/>Jacob will break his clods.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Sow to yourselves in righteousness,<br/>reap according to kindness.<br/>Break up your fallow ground,<br/>for it is time to seek the LORD,<br/>until he comes and rains righteousness on you.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>You have plowed wickedness.<br/>You have reaped iniquity.<br/>You have eaten the fruit of lies,<br/>for you trusted in your way, in the multitude of your mighty men.<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Therefore a battle roar will arise among your people,<br/>and all your fortresses will be destroyed,<br/>as Shalman destroyed Beth Arbel in the day of battle.<br/>The mother was dashed in pieces with her children.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>So Bethel will do to you because of your great wickedness.<br/>At daybreak the king of Israel will be destroyed.</p></blockquote></section>
