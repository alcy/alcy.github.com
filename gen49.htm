He blessed everyone according to his own blessing.   <span class="verse" id="V29"></span>He instructed them, and said to them, “I am to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,   <span class="verse" id="V30"></span>in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite as a burial place.   <span class="verse" id="V31"></span>There they buried Abraham and Sarah, his wife. There they buried Isaac and Rebekah, his wife, and there I buried Leah:   <span class="verse" id="V32"></span>the field and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the children of Heth.”   <span class="verse" id="V33"></span>When Jacob finished charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, breathed his last breath, and was gathered to his people. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="gen50.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
