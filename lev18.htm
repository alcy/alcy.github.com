You shall not do as they do in the land of Canaan, where I am bringing you. You shall not follow their statutes.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>You shall do my ordinances. You shall keep my statutes and walk in them. I am the LORD your God.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>You shall therefore keep my statutes and my ordinances, which if a man does, he shall live in them. I am the LORD.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>“ ‘None of you shall approach any close relatives, to uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>“ ‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father, nor the nakedness of your mother: she is your mother. You shall not uncover her nakedness.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>“ ‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s wife. It is your father’s nakedness.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>“ ‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father, or the daughter of your mother, whether born at home or born abroad.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>“ ‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your son’s daughter, or of your daughter’s daughter, even their nakedness; for theirs is your own nakedness.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>“ ‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s wife’s daughter, conceived by your father, since she is your sister.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>“ ‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s sister. She is your father’s near kinswoman.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>“ ‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister, for she is your mother’s near kinswoman.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>“ ‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s brother. You shall not approach his wife. She is your aunt.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>“ ‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law. She is your son’s wife. You shall not uncover her nakedness.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>“ ‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother’s wife. It is your brother’s nakedness.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>“ ‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter. You shall not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness. They are near kinswomen. It is wickedness.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>“ ‘You shall not take a wife in addition to her sister, to be a rival, to uncover her nakedness, while her sister is still alive.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>“ ‘You shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is impure by her uncleanness.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>“ ‘You shall not lie carnally with your neighbor’s wife, and defile yourself with her.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>“ ‘You shall not give any of your children as a sacrifice to Molech.

I am the LORD your God.’ ”</p></section>
