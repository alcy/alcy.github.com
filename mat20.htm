        A denarius is a silver Roman coin worth 1/25th of a Roman aureus. This was a common wage for a day of farm labor.

        Time was measured from sunrise to sunset, so the third hour would be about 9:00 a.m.

He said to them, ‘Why do you stand here all day idle?’ </span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V7"></span><span class="wj">“They said to him, ‘Because no one has hired us.’</span></p><p><span class="wj">“He said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and you will receive whatever is right.’ </span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V8"></span><span class="wj">“When evening had come, the lord of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning from the last to the first.’</span> <span class="verse" id="V9"></span><span class="wj">“When those who were hired at about the eleventh hour came, they each received a denarius. </span> <span class="verse" id="V10"></span><span class="wj">When the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise each received a denarius. </span> <span class="verse" id="V11"></span><span class="wj">When they received it, they murmured against the master of the household, </span> <span class="verse" id="V12"></span><span class="wj">saying, ‘These last have spent one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat!’ </span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span><span class="wj">“But he answered one of them, ‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong.

It is my desire to give to this last just as much as to you. </span> <span class="verse" id="V15"></span><span class="wj">Isn’t it lawful for me to do what I want to with what I own? Or is your eye evil, because I am good?’ </span> <span class="verse" id="V16"></span><span class="wj">So the last will be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few are chosen.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them,   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span><span class="wj">“Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death, </span> <span class="verse" id="V19"></span><span class="wj">and will hand him over to the Gentiles to mock, to scourge, and to crucify; and the third day he will be raised up.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, kneeling and asking a certain thing of him.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>He said to her, <span class="wj">“What do you want?”</span></p><p>She said to him, “Command that these, my two sons, may sit, one on your right hand and one on your left hand, in your Kingdom.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>But Jesus answered, <span class="wj">“You don’t know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?”</span></p><p>They said to him, “We are able.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“You will indeed drink my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with; but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give, but it is for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>When the ten heard it, they were indignant with the two brothers.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V25"></span>But Jesus summoned them, and said, <span class="wj">“You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. </span> <span class="verse" id="V26"></span><span class="wj">It shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you shall be</span><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="mat-20-26-note-1">
