    <section><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>“For, behold, in those days,<br/>and in that time,<br/>when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,<br/><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>I will gather all nations,<br/>and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat;<br/>and I will execute judgment on them there for my people,<br/>and for my heritage, Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations.<br/>They have divided my land,<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>and have cast lots for my people,<br/>and have given a boy for a prostitute,<br/>and sold a girl for wine, that they may drink.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>“Yes, and what are you to me, Tyre and Sidon,<br/>and all the regions of Philistia?<br/>Will you repay me?<br/>And if you repay me,<br/>I will swiftly and speedily return your repayment on your own head.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Because you have taken my silver and my gold,<br/>and have carried my finest treasures into your temples,<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>and have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks,<br/>that you may remove them far from their border.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Behold, I will stir them up out of the place where you have sold them,<br/>and will return your repayment on your own head;<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of the children of Judah,<br/>and they will sell them to the men of Sheba,<br/>to a faraway nation,<br/>for the LORD has spoken it.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Proclaim this among the nations:<br/>“Prepare for war!<br/>Stir up the mighty men.<br/>Let all the warriors draw near.<br/>Let them come up.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Beat your plowshares into swords,<br/>and your pruning hooks into spears.<br/>Let the weak say, ‘I am strong.’<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Hurry and come, all you surrounding nations,<br/>and gather yourselves together.”<br/>Cause your mighty ones to come down there, LORD.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>“Let the nations arouse themselves,<br/>and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat;<br/>for there I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Put in the sickle;<br/>for the harvest is ripe.<br/>Come, tread, for the wine press is full,<br/>the vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.”<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision!<br/>For the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>The sun and the moon are darkened,<br/>and the stars withdraw their shining.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>The LORD will roar from Zion,<br/>and thunder from Jerusalem;<br/>and the heavens and the earth will shake;<br/>but the LORD will be a refuge to his people,<br/>and a stronghold to the children of Israel.<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>“So you will know that I am the LORD, your God,<br/>dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain.<br/>Then Jerusalem will be holy,<br/>and no strangers will pass through her any more.<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>It will happen in that day,<br/>that the mountains will drop down sweet wine,<br/>the hills will flow with milk,<br/>all the brooks of Judah will flow with waters;<br/>and a fountain will flow out from the LORD’s house,<br/>and will water the valley of Shittim.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Egypt will be a desolation<br/>and Edom will be a desolate wilderness,<br/>for the violence done to the children of Judah,<br/>because they have shed innocent blood in their land.<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>But Judah will be inhabited forever,<br/>and Jerusalem from generation to generation.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>I will cleanse their blood<br/>that I have not cleansed,<br/>for the LORD dwells in Zion.”</p></blockquote></section>
