They shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother and his sons, that he may minister to me in the priest’s office.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>They shall use the gold, and the blue, and the purple, and the scarlet, and the fine linen.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>“They shall make the ephod of gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the skillful workman.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>It shall have two shoulder straps joined to the two ends of it, that it may be joined together.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>The skillfully woven band, which is on it, shall be like its work and of the same piece; of gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>You shall take two onyx stones, and engrave on them the names of the children of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Six of their names on the one stone, and the names of the six that remain on the other stone, in the order of their birth.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>With the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of a signet, you shall engrave the two stones, according to the names of the children of Israel. You shall make them to be enclosed in settings of gold.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>You shall put the two stones on the shoulder straps of the ephod, to be stones of memorial for the children of Israel. Aaron shall bear their names before the LORD on his two shoulders for a memorial.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>You shall make settings of gold,   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>and two chains of pure gold; you shall make them like cords of braided work.

It shall be on the front of the sash.   <span class="verse" id="V38"></span>It shall be on Aaron’s forehead, and Aaron shall bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall make holy in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always on his forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD.   <span class="verse" id="V39"></span>You shall weave the tunic with fine linen. You shall make a turban of fine linen. You shall make a sash, the work of the embroiderer.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V40"></span>“You shall make tunics for Aaron’s sons.
