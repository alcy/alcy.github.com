    <h1>Paul's Letter to the Colossians</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>If then you were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of God.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>When Christ, our life, is revealed, then you will also be revealed with him in glory.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth: sexual immorality, uncleanness, depraved passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>For these things’ sake the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>You also once walked in those, when you lived in them,   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>but now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and shameful speaking out of your mouth.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Don’t lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings,   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>and have put on the new man, who is being renewed in knowledge after the image of his Creator,   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>where there can’t be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondservant, or free person; but Christ is all, and in all.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Put on therefore, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, humility, and perseverance;   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, if any man has a complaint against any; even as Christ forgave you, so you also do.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Above all these things, walk in love, which is the bond of perfection.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body, and be thankful.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your heart to the Lord.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>Whatever you do, in word or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>Husbands, love your wives, and don’t be bitter against them.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Children, obey your parents in all things, for this pleases the Lord.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Fathers, don’t provoke your children, so that they won’t be discouraged.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Servants, obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh, not just when they are looking, as men pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God.   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>And whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men,   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ.   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>But he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that he has done, and there is no partiality. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="col04.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
