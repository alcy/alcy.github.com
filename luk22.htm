    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>The chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death, for they feared the people.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Satan entered into Judas, who was also called Iscariot, who was counted with the twelve.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>He went away and talked with the chief priests and captains about how he might deliver him to them.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>They were glad, and agreed to give him money.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>He consented and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence of the multitude.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>The day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, <span class="wj">“Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>They said to him, “Where do you want us to prepare?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters. </span> <span class="verse" id="V11"></span><span class="wj">Tell the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?” ’ </span> <span class="verse" id="V12"></span><span class="wj">He will show you a large, furnished upper room. Make preparations there.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>They went, found things as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>When the hour had come, he sat down with the twelve apostles.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer, </span> <span class="verse" id="V16"></span><span class="wj">for I tell you, I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in God’s Kingdom.”</span> <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>He received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, <span class="wj">“Take this and share it among yourselves, </span> <span class="verse" id="V18"></span><span class="wj">for I tell you, I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine, until God’s Kingdom comes.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>He took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke and gave it to them, saying, <span class="wj">“This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of me.”</span> <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Likewise, he took the cup after supper, saying, <span class="wj">“This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you. </span> <span class="verse" id="V21"></span><span class="wj">But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table. </span> <span class="verse" id="V22"></span><span class="wj">The Son of Man indeed goes as it has been determined, but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V23"></span>They began to question among themselves which of them it was who would do this thing.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>A dispute also arose among them, which of them was considered to be greatest.   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>He said to them, <span class="wj">“The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called ‘benefactors.’ </span> <span class="verse" id="V26"></span><span class="wj">But not so with you. Rather, the one who is greater among you, let him become as the younger, and one who is governing, as one who serves. </span> <span class="verse" id="V27"></span><span class="wj">For who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves? Isn’t it he who sits at the table? But I am among you as one who serves. </span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V28"></span><span class="wj">“But you are those who have continued with me in my trials. </span> <span class="verse" id="V29"></span><span class="wj">I confer on you a kingdom, even as my Father conferred on me, </span> <span class="verse" id="V30"></span><span class="wj">that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom. You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V31"></span>The Lord said, <span class="wj">“Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have all of you, that he might sift you as wheat, </span> <span class="verse" id="V32"></span><span class="wj">but I prayed for you, that your faith wouldn’t fail. You, when once you have turned again, establish your brothers.”</span><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="luk-22-32-note-1">

</span> <span class="wj">For that which concerns me is being fulfilled.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V38"></span>They said, “Lord, behold, here are two swords.”</p><p>He said to them, <span class="wj">“That is enough.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V39"></span>He came out and went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also followed him.   <span class="verse" id="V40"></span>When he was at the place, he said to them, <span class="wj">“Pray that you don’t enter into temptation.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V41"></span>He was withdrawn from them about a stone’s throw, and he knelt down and prayed,   <span class="verse" id="V42"></span>saying, <span class="wj">“Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V43"></span>An angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.   <span class="verse" id="V44"></span>Being in agony, he prayed more earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V45"></span>When he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping because of grief,   <span class="verse" id="V46"></span>and said to them, <span class="wj">“Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V47"></span>While he was still speaking, a crowd appeared. He who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He came near to Jesus to kiss him.   <span class="verse" id="V48"></span>But Jesus said to him, <span class="wj">“Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V49"></span>When those who were around him saw what was about to happen, they said to him, “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?”   <span class="verse" id="V50"></span>A certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V51"></span>But Jesus answered, <span class="wj">“Let me at least do this”</span>—and he touched his ear and healed him.   <span class="verse" id="V52"></span>Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and elders, who had come against him, <span class="wj">“Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs? </span> <span class="verse" id="V53"></span><span class="wj">When I was with you in the temple daily, you didn’t stretch out your hands against me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.” </span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V54"></span>They seized him and led him away, and brought him into the high priest’s house. But Peter followed from a distance.   <span class="verse" id="V55"></span>When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat among them.   <span class="verse" id="V56"></span>A certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light, and looking intently at him, said, “This man also was with him.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V57"></span>He denied Jesus, saying, “Woman, I don’t know him.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V58"></span>After a little while someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them!”</p><p>But Peter answered, “Man, I am not!”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V59"></span>After about one hour passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, “Truly this man also was with him, for he is a Galilean!”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V60"></span>But Peter said, “Man, I don’t know what you are talking about!” Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.   <span class="verse" id="V61"></span>The Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the Lord’s word, how he said to him, <span class="wj">“Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times.”</span> <span class="verse" id="V62"></span>He went out, and wept bitterly.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V63"></span>The men who held Jesus mocked him and beat him.   <span class="verse" id="V64"></span>Having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, “Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?”   <span class="verse" id="V65"></span>They spoke many other things against him, insulting him.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V66"></span>As soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people were gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, and they led him away into their council, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V67"></span>“If you are the Christ, tell us.”</p><p>But he said to them, <span class="wj">“If I tell you, you won’t believe, </span> <span class="verse" id="V68"></span><span class="wj">and if I ask, you will in no way answer me or let me go. </span> <span class="verse" id="V69"></span><span class="wj">From now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V70"></span>They all said, “Are you then the Son of God?”</p><p>He said to them, <span class="wj">“You say it, because I am.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V71"></span>They said, “Why do we need any more witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth!”</p></section>
