His wrath was kindled because he justified himself rather than God.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Also his wrath was kindled against his three friends, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job, because they were older than he.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered,</p><blockquote><p>“I am young, and you are very old.<br/>Therefore I held back, and didn’t dare show you my opinion.<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>I said, ‘Days should speak,<br/>and multitude of years should teach wisdom.’<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>But there is a spirit in man,<br/>and the Spirit<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="job-32-8-note-1">
