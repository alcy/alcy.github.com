    <h1>The Letter from James</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Where do wars and fightings among you come from? Don’t they come from your pleasures that war in your members?   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>You lust, and don’t have. You murder and covet, and can’t obtain. You fight and make war. You don’t have, because you don’t ask.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>You ask, and don’t receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your pleasures.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>You adulterers and adulteresses, don’t you know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, “The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously”?   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="jas-4-6-note-1">

<a href="pro03.htm#v34">Proverbs 3:34</a>
</span> <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Be subject therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners. Purify your hearts, you double-minded.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Lament, mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Don’t speak against one another, brothers. He who speaks against a brother and judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Only one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge another?</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow let’s go into this city and spend a year there, trade, and make a profit.”   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Yet you don’t know what your life will be like tomorrow. For what is your life? For you are a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>For you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we will both live, and do this or that.”   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>But now you glory in your boasting. All such boasting is evil.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>To him therefore who knows to do good and doesn’t do it, to him it is sin.</p></section>
