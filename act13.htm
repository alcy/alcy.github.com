    <h1>The Acts of the Apostles</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 13</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Now in the assembly that was at Antioch there were some prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>As they served the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, “Separate Barnabas and Saul for me, for the work to which I have called them.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia. From there they sailed to Cyprus.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>When they were at Salamis, they proclaimed God’s word in the Jewish synagogues. They also had John as their attendant.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>When they had gone through the island to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew whose name was Bar Jesus,   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of understanding. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul, and sought to hear the word of God.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fastened his eyes on him   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>and said, “You son of the devil, full of all deceit and all cunning, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Now, behold, the hand of the Lord is on you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun for a season!”</p><p>Immediately a mist and darkness fell on him. He went around seeking someone to lead him by the hand.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>But they, passing on from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia. They went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and sat down.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>After the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, “Brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, speak.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>Paul stood up, and gesturing with his hand said, “Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>The God of this people<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="act-13-17-note-1">

Since indeed you thrust it from yourselves, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.   <span class="verse" id="V47"></span>For so has the Lord commanded us, saying,</p><blockquote><p>‘I have set you as a light for the Gentiles,<br/>that you should bring salvation to the uttermost parts of the earth.’ ” <label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="act-13-47-note-1">

As many as were appointed to eternal life believed.   <span class="verse" id="V49"></span>The Lord’s word was spread abroad throughout all the region.   <span class="verse" id="V50"></span>But the Jews stirred up the devout and prominent women and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and threw them out of their borders.   <span class="verse" id="V51"></span>But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came to Iconium.   <span class="verse" id="V52"></span>The disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="act14.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
