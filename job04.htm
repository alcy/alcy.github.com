    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,</p><blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V2"></span>“If someone ventures to talk with you, will you be grieved?<br/>But who can withhold himself from speaking?<br/><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>Behold, you have instructed many,<br/>you have strengthened the weak hands.<br/><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Your words have supported him who was falling,<br/>you have made the feeble knees firm.<br/><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>But now it has come to you, and you faint.<br/>It touches you, and you are troubled.<br/><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Isn’t your piety your confidence?<br/>Isn’t the integrity of your ways your hope?<br/><span class="verse" id="V7"></span>“Remember, now, who ever perished, being innocent?<br/>Or where were the upright cut off?<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity<br/>and sow trouble, reap the same.<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>By the breath of God they perish.<br/>By the blast of his anger are they consumed.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>The roaring of the lion,<br/>and the voice of the fierce lion,<br/>the teeth of the young lions, are broken.<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>The old lion perishes for lack of prey.<br/>The cubs of the lioness are scattered abroad.<br/><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>“Now a thing was secretly brought to me.<br/>My ear received a whisper of it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>In thoughts from the visions of the night,<br/>when deep sleep falls on men,<br/><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>fear came on me, and trembling,<br/>which made all my bones shake.<br/><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Then a spirit passed before my face.<br/>The hair of my flesh stood up.<br/><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>It stood still, but I couldn’t discern its appearance.<br/>A form was before my eyes.<br/>Silence, then I heard a voice, saying,<br/><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>‘Shall mortal man be more just than God?<br/>Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?<br/><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Behold, he puts no trust in his servants.<br/>He charges his angels with error.<br/><span class="verse" id="V19"></span>How much more those who dwell in houses of clay,<br/>whose foundation is in the dust,<br/>who are crushed before the moth!<br/><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Between morning and evening they are destroyed.<br/>They perish forever without any regarding it.<br/><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Isn’t their tent cord plucked up within them?<br/>They die, and that without wisdom.’</p></blockquote></section>
