    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession: Jesus,   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also Moses was in all his house.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, because he who built the house has more honor than the house.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>For every house is built by someone; but he who built all things is God.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken,   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>but Christ<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="heb-3-6-note-1">

        “Christ” means “Anointed One”.
        </span> is faithful as a Son over his house. We are his house, if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the end.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says,</p><blockquote><p>“Today if you will hear his voice,<br/><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>don’t harden your hearts as in the rebellion,<br/>in the day of the trial in the wilderness,<br/><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>where your fathers tested me and tried me,<br/>and saw my deeds for forty years.<br/><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Therefore I was displeased with that generation,<br/>and said, ‘They always err in their heart,<br/>but they didn’t know my ways.’<br/><span class="verse" id="V11"></span>As I swore in my wrath,<br/>‘They will not enter into my rest.’ ”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="heb-3-11-note-1">

</span></p></blockquote><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there might be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God;   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called “today”, lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence firm to the end,   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>while it is said,</p><blockquote><p>“Today if you will hear his voice,<br/>don’t harden your hearts, as in the rebellion.”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="heb-3-15-note-1">

Wasn’t it all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses?   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>With whom was he displeased forty years? Wasn’t it with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>To whom did he swear that they wouldn’t enter into his rest, but to those who were disobedient?   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>We see that they weren’t able to enter in because of unbelief.</p></section>
