    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Immediately in the morning the chief priests, with the elders, scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, bound Jesus, carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”</p><p>He answered, <span class="wj">“So you say.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V3"></span>The chief priests accused him of many things.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Pilate again asked him, “Have you no answer? See how many things they testify against you!”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate marveled.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whomever they asked of him.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>There was one called Barabbas, bound with his fellow insurgents, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>The multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Pilate answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Pilate again asked them, “What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>They cried out again, “Crucify him!”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Pilate said to them, “Why, what evil has he done?”</p><p>But they cried out exceedingly, “Crucify him!”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V15"></span>Pilate, wishing to please the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and handed over Jesus, when he had flogged him, to be crucified.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>The soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole cohort.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>They clothed him with purple; and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>They began to salute him, “Hail, King of the Jews!”   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>They struck his head with a reed and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him.   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>When they had mocked him, they took the purple cloak off him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to crucify him.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V21"></span>They compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them that he might bear his cross.   <span class="verse" id="V22"></span>They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, “The place of a skull.”   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he didn’t take it.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V24"></span>Crucifying him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take.   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>It was the third hour<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="mrk-15-25-note-1">
