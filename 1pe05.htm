    <h1>Peter's First Letter</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Therefore I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and who will also share in the glory that will be revealed:   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>shepherd the flock of God which is among you, exercising the oversight, not under compulsion, but voluntarily; not for dishonest gain, but willingly;   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>not as lording it over those entrusted to you, but making yourselves examples to the flock.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>When the chief Shepherd is revealed, you will receive the crown of glory that doesn’t fade away.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>Likewise, you younger ones, be subject to the elder. Yes, all of you clothe yourselves with humility and subject yourselves to one another; for “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="1pe-5-5-note-1">

<a href="pro03.htm#v34">Proverbs 3:34</a>
</span> <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time,   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>casting all your worries on him, because he cares for you.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>Be sober and self-controlled. Be watchful. Your adversary, the devil, walks around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>Withstand him steadfast in your faith, knowing that your brothers who are in the world are undergoing the same sufferings.   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>But may the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>To him be the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>Through Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I consider him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, greets you. So does Mark, my son.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Greet one another with a kiss of love.</p><p>Peace be to all of you who are in Christ Jesus. Amen. <span class="nav-ribbon-bottom"><a class="nav-arrow nav-next" href="2pe01.htm">→</a></span></p></section>
