It came as far as me.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>When I had looked intently at it, I considered, and saw the four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, creeping things, and birds of the sky.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>I also heard a voice saying to me, <span class="wj">‘Rise, Peter, kill and eat!’ </span> <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>But I said, ‘Not so, Lord, for nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered into my mouth.’   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>But a voice answered me the second time out of heaven, <span class="wj">‘What God has cleansed, don’t you call unclean.’</span> <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>This was done three times, and all were drawn up again into heaven.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>Behold, immediately three men stood before the house where I was, having been sent from Caesarea to me.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>The Spirit told me to go with them without discriminating.
