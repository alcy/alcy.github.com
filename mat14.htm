    <h1>Matthew</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 14</h2>
    
    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus,   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>and said to his servants, “This is John the Baptizer. He is risen from the dead. That is why these powers work in him.”   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>For Herod had arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>For John said to him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.”   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>When he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced among them and pleased Herod.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Therefore he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>She, being prompted by her mother, said, “Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptizer.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V9"></span>The king was grieved, but for the sake of his oaths and of those who sat at the table with him, he commanded it to be given,   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>and he sent and beheaded John in the prison.   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>His head was brought on a platter and given to the young lady; and she brought it to her mother.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>His disciples came, took the body, and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a deserted place apart. When the multitudes heard it, they followed him on foot from the cities.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>Jesus went out, and he saw a great multitude. He had compassion on them and healed their sick.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>When evening had come, his disciples came to him, saying, “This place is deserted, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>But Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“They don’t need to go away. You give them something to eat.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V17"></span>They told him, “We only have here five loaves and two fish.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V18"></span>He said, <span class="wj">“Bring them here to me.”</span> <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, broke and gave the loaves to the disciples; and the disciples gave to the multitudes.   <span class="verse" id="V20"></span>They all ate and were filled. They took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces.   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>Those who ate were about five thousand men, in addition to women and children.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V22"></span>Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.   <span class="verse" id="V23"></span>After he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. When evening had come, he was there alone.   <span class="verse" id="V24"></span>But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, distressed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.   <span class="verse" id="V25"></span>In the fourth watch of the night,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="mat-14-25-note-1">

        The night was equally divided into four watches, so the fourth watch is approximately 3:00 a.m. to sunrise.

</span> <span class="verse" id="V26"></span>When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, “It’s a ghost!” and they cried out for fear.   <span class="verse" id="V27"></span>But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, <span class="wj">“Cheer up!
