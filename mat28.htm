    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky and came and rolled away the stone from the door and sat on it.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men.   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>The angel answered the women, “Don’t be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified.   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying.   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>Go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.’ Behold, I have told you.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V8"></span>They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, <span class="wj">“Rejoice!”</span></p><p>They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V10"></span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class="wj">“Don’t be afraid.

This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until today.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V16"></span>But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them.   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>When they saw him, they bowed down to him; but some doubted.   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying, <span class="wj">“All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. </span> <span class="verse" id="V19"></span><span class="wj">Go</span><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="mat-28-19-note-1">
