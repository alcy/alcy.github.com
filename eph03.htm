    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>For this cause I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles,   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>if it is so that you have heard of the administration of that grace of God which was given me toward you,   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>how that by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I wrote before in few words,   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>by which, when you read, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ,   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>which in other generations was not made known to the children of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit,   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of his promise in Christ Jesus through the Good News,   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>of which I was made a servant according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>To me, the very least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>and to make all men see what is the administration<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="eph-3-9-note-1">

        </span> of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God, who created all things through Jesus Christ,   <span class="verse" id="V10"></span>to the intent that now through the assembly the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places,   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>according to the eternal purpose which he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V12"></span>In him we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him.   <span class="verse" id="V13"></span>Therefore I ask that you may not lose heart at my troubles for you, which are your glory.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V14"></span>For this cause, I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that you may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner person,   <span class="verse" id="V17"></span>that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, to the end that you, being rooted and grounded in love,   <span class="verse" id="V18"></span>may be strengthened to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and height and depth,   <span class="verse" id="V19"></span>and to know Christ’s love which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V20"></span>Now to him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,   <span class="verse" id="V21"></span>to him be the glory in the assembly and in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever.
