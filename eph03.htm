    <section><p><span class="verse" id="V1"></span>For this cause I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles,   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>if it is so that you have heard of the administration of that grace of God which was given me toward you,   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>how that by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I wrote before in few words,   <span class="verse" id="V4"></span>by which, when you read, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ,   <span class="verse" id="V5"></span>which in other generations was not made known to the children of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit,   <span class="verse" id="V6"></span>that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of his promise in Christ Jesus through the Good News,   <span class="verse" id="V7"></span>of which I was made a servant according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power.   <span class="verse" id="V8"></span>To me, the very least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,   <span class="verse" id="V9"></span>and to make all men see what is the administration<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="eph-3-9-note-1">
