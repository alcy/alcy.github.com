Jesus’ mother was there.   <span class="verse" id="V2"></span>Jesus also was invited, with his disciples, to the wedding.   <span class="verse" id="V3"></span>When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no wine.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V4"></span>Jesus said to her, <span class="wj">“Woman, what does that have to do with you and me? My hour has not yet come.”</span></p><p><span class="verse" id="V5"></span>His mother said to the servants, “Whatever he says to you, do it.”</p><p><span class="verse" id="V6"></span>Now there were six water pots of stone set there after the Jews’ way of purifying, containing two or three metretes<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="jhn-2-6-note-1">

You have kept the good wine until now!”   <span class="verse" id="V11"></span>This beginning of his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V12"></span>After this, he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; and they stayed there a few days.</p><p><span class="verse" id="V13"></span>The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V14"></span>He found in the temple those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting.   <span class="verse" id="V15"></span>He made a whip of cords and drove all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers’ money and overthrew their tables.   <span class="verse" id="V16"></span>To those who sold the doves, he said, <span class="wj">“Take these things out of here!
